Character,Dialogue
Barret,"Get down here, merc."
Barret,You're up.
Cloud,Don't think so.
Cloud,Go ahead.
Cloud,Enough of this.
Cloud,Can't get surrounded.
Cloud,"This is a onetime gig. When it's done, we're done."
Cloud,Not interested.
Barret,Wedge!
Barret,"You'd better be worth the money, merc. Every last gil."
Cloud,Guess you're first.
Cloud,Looks like you're next.
Barret,You know what to do—now go!
Barret,Pick up the pace!
Barret,"SOLDIERs may attack on command, but I hear they make good guard dogs too. Bet you've seen a few reactors. So how do we get to the bridge above mako storage?"
Barret,"Ain't holding out on me, are you? Stamp scared to bite the hand that fed him? Or is he a loyal little doggie!?"
Barret,"Have it your way, mutt. We can do this with you, or we can do this without you."
Cloud,"Different reactor, different layout. Depends when it was built. Never seen one like this, but I'll manage."
Barret,I'm watching you.
Barret,W-wait!
Cloud,That's my line.
Cloud,Then let's move.
Barret,Cut it out!
Barret,"Simmer down, hotshot."
Barret,"Security's only gonna get tighter, so be ready. We can't afford any mistakes."
Tifa,Cloud! Are you ignoring me!?
Cloud,Tifa and I...
Barret,"This pump's sole purpose is to drain the planet dry. While you sleep, while you eat, while you shit—it's here, sucking up mako. It doesn't rest and it doesn't care! You do realize what mako is, don't you?"
Barret,"Mako is the lifeblood of our world. The planet bleeds green like you and me bleed red. The hell you think's gonna happen when it's all gone, huh!? Answer me!"
Barret,You gonna stand there and pretend you can't hear the planet crying out in pain? I know you can!
Cloud,You really hear that?
Barret,Damn straight I do!
Cloud,Get help.
Barret,Say that again!
Cloud,I'd worry less about the planet and more about the next five seconds. Save the screaming for later.
Barret,"Our lives are on the line now. You listening, merc? One false move... And that happens!"
Cloud,Should've asked for more money.
Barret,Gonna throw your sword at 'em? Let the man with the gun go to work! These tin cans ain't got nothing on me!
Barret,Now for the real show!
Barret,"Do your job, merc!"
Cloud,Shut up and move over.
Cloud,Don't forget to aim.
Barret,Oh yeah? How about I aim for your head!?
Cloud,A laser security system... Great.
Cloud,Yeah. Figure out the timing of the lasers. Then make a move when they cycle off.
Cloud,Hey!
Cloud,Not if you wipe the floor with them first.
Barret,Hah! We can take this hunk of junk!
Cloud,"That ""hunk of junk"" is a heavy weapons platform. If we rush in...we die."
Barret,Is that right?
Cloud,Need to hit it with magic. That should give us an opening.
Barret,Hey! It stopped moving!
Cloud,Let's pin it down! Give it all you've got!
Barret,"Of course, it just had to get back up."
Cloud,So we knock it down again. No time to complain.
Cloud,Now's our chance! Go!
Barret,Don't need to tell me twice! I'm gonna enjoy this!
Barret,"What are you, twenty-something?"
Cloud,First.
Barret,Huh?
Cloud,SOLDIER First Class. Doesn't go into the twenties.
Barret,"The hell you talking about? I mean your age, not your goddamn rank!"
Cloud,"I, uh..."
Barret,"Though, for all I know, a SOLDIER's rank could be the same as his age... Mm-hmm. Guess that'd make you a one-year-old, huh? Live and learn!"
Barret,Goddamn... I can practically taste the mako in here... Hurry it up!
Barret,My heart's pounding like a jackhammer!
Cloud,"Scared, huh?"
Barret,Hah! More like excited. I've been dreaming about this for years!
Barret,"You think, if we fell in, we'd sink right down to the bottom? To the planet's core?"
Cloud,"No, the pump would suck us back up."
Barret,How comforting.
Barret,"Yeah, let's do this... Let's do this!"
Barret,All right. Let's see if little Stamp really can bite the hand that feeds...
Barret,Go on. Do the honors. Prove to me you're the man Tifa says you are. That you're one of us.
Cloud,Never said I was. I'm just here for the paycheck.
Barret,Then do the damn job!
Barret,What's wrong?
Cloud,I'm fine. What about the timer?
Barret,"Your call, merc."
Barret,"Pretty cocky, ain'tcha?"
Barret,Hah! That long enough for you?
Barret,You double-crossing—
Cloud,Heads up!
Barret,What in the hell!?
Barret,Hey! How the hell do we fight this thing?
Cloud,It's got reinforced armor plating—but the internals can be overloaded. Lightning magic.
Barret,"No other option, huh."
Cloud,Can't see an opening... Impressive...
Barret,"Damn, this thing is tough!"
Cloud,Wouldn't be much of a weapon if it went down easy.
Barret,Don't compliment the giant scorpion!
Cloud,Gotta heal up.
Barret,Sure could use a break...
Cloud,Damnit. Need to heal up soon...
Cloud,Gotta memorize the attack patterns...
Cloud,Gotta time our attacks just right! Hold out until you spot an opening!
Barret,Hell yeah! You see the damage that did!?
Cloud,Keep it up!
Barret,We barely scratched the damn thing!
Cloud,Didn't I tell you to use magic!?
Barret,Thought you were full of shit.
Cloud,Think whatever you want—just do it!
Barret,Damn pain in the ass...
Barret,Got anything you wanna say?
Barret,Funny way to ask for help.
Barret,Shit. Was just about to get you out.
Cloud,Wasn't expecting you to do jack...
Barret,Pretty quick for a heap of scrap!
Barret,The hell is that!?
Cloud,A barrier? Never seen this defense system before...
Barret,Thought you were the expert!
Cloud,"So what's your brilliant plan, genius?"
Cloud,There! Attack it from the rear!
Barret,"Aight, SOLDIER boy! Show me what you got!"
Cloud,Bingo. Focus on that core!
Barret,"Oh, now he remembers. Don't keep me waiting in suspense next time!"
Barret,Huh!? It didn't work!?
Barret,Dammit! Gotta do something about that barrier first!
Barret,"Damn, this thing is tough!"
Cloud,Wouldn't be much of a weapon if it went down easy.
Barret,Don't compliment the giant scorpion!
Barret,(chuckles) It's my time to shine!
Cloud,Or go down in flames...
Cloud,Another barrier!?
Barret,Enough with the barriers!
Cloud,Watch the tail! You don't want to get hit by that laser!
Barret,"Huh!? So, whadda we do!?"
Cloud,Don't get hit! Take cover behind that debris.
Cloud,Now! Go!
Barret,Now! Get in there and do some damage!
Barret,It's wide open! Gonna light it up!
Cloud,Heads up—tail laser!
Barret,I see it!
Cloud,Then take cover already!
Cloud,Incoming—take cover!
Barret,There really no other option?
Cloud,Wanna get shot? Be my guest!
Barret,"Hey, it's doing that thing again!"
Cloud,Find cover and hunker down!
Barret,Again and again and again!
Cloud,Now! Go!
Barret,"Aw, hell, what's it doing now!?"
Cloud,An auto-repair unit? Dammit—we gotta take it out quick or we're screwed!
Barret,"Oh, I am way ahead of you, merc!"
Barret,"When I get my chance, I'm gonna blow this bastard the hell up! And that's a promise!"
Cloud,Gotta time our attacks just right! Hold out until you spot an opening!
Cloud,It's down! Rain hell on it!
Barret,Ain't gotta tell me twice!
Cloud,There goes another! Now's our chance to do some real damage!
Barret,Shit! The bomb!
Barret,"Hah, you hear that? Damn thing showed you how it's done!"
Cloud,"Come on, we've gotta move."
Barret,"Wedge should be covering our way out! Go, go, go!"
Cloud,You okay?
Barret,Hey! We'll link up over there! Look after Jessie!
Cloud,Shut up and climb. You're not helping.
Cloud,Have it your way.
Barret,I've got you covered. Find us a way outta here!
Barret,"Don't worry, I'll be fine. I've got SOLDIER boy with me!"
Cloud,Ex-SOLDIER boy.
Barret,We don't have time for this shit! The clock's ticking!
Cloud,Cool it. Five seconds is all we need.
Barret,You don't look so good. Take care of those wounds before you bleed out.
Barret,Let's go! The others are waiting! Gotta get the hell outta here ASAP...
Barret,Ugh! This is all we need!
Cloud,You got that right.
Barret,Heads up! We got a whole lotta company!
Cloud,No shit.
Barret,Whoa! Ain't you a feisty one!
Cloud,Like a rook seeing his first action...
Barret,"Come on...come on, come on, come on!"
Barret,Bada-bing bada-boom—bam!
Cloud,Can you walk?
Cloud,I'll take that as a yes.
Barret,Looks like we made it. And with nothing but a few scratches to show—
Barret,Think you might've overdone it?
Barret,"Well, let's hope this city's still in one piece."
Barret,"All right, then. Lead the way."
Barret,We need to get out of this place.
Barret,You can refuel at the base.
Barret,"Can't wait to see you, Marlene."
Cloud,What's done is done.
Barret,"Merc's right. It ain't pretty, but we can't stop now. This was just the first reactor. And the planet won't be safe till we get the rest."
Barret,"Y'all gotta look at the bigger picture here. Nothing worth fighting for was ever won without sacrifice. Though you may not be crying out, I know you're in pain—just like the planet. But it's okay, 'cause I'm here for you! To help take the load off your shoulders!"
Barret,"Your fears... Your worries... Your concerns... And yes, your fees... Whatever your problem, I got you."
Barret,That's easy enough! We get our asses home!
Barret,We'll split up and shoot for the last train home. Regroup in the freight car. Got it?
Cloud,Hey. I'd like my money now.
Barret,You can have it—once we're back at base.
Cloud,Of course not. It's healing materia.
Cloud,Just doing my job. Nothing more.
Cloud,Survival can be a matter of luck or skill. And you can't rely on luck.
Cloud,"Yeah, well...thanks."
Cloud,"You do know what I was, right?"
Cloud,Station's intact.
Cloud,What the...?
Cloud,How...!?
Cloud,He couldn't be... But then...
Cloud,The hell...?
Cloud,Wait...
Cloud,You're not real... You're... ...dead!
Sephiroth,I am?
Cloud,I killed you with my own—
Sephiroth,"Oh, you need not remind me. It was the crowning moment of our time together. But that was then, and this is now. I have a favor to ask."
Sephiroth,Our beloved planet is dying. Slowly. Silently. Painfully. Can you bear to see the planet suffer... Cloud?
Cloud,Mom... Mom...
Sephiroth,"Were the planet to die, so many things would be lost. Your hometown that burns so bright... The sound of her voice pleading for me to spare you. The shiver of her flesh yielding to cold steel."
Sephiroth,That which binds us together would be no more. And I would be loath to live in such a world. Which is why I must ask you this one favor. Don't worry. It's a simple thing.
Sephiroth,"Run, Cloud... Run away. You have to leave... You have to live."
Cloud,You bastard!
Cloud,"I'm seeing things. Fumes from all the mako, maybe. All right. You got this."
Cloud,Man... What a mess.
Cloud,Security's everywhere...
Cloud,No need to make it harder for yourself.
Sephiroth,You are too weak to save anyone. Not even yourself.
Cloud,I'm fine.
Cloud,A flower?
Cloud,What things?
Cloud,Just my luck...
Cloud,How much?
Cloud,I'm good.
Cloud,How much?
Cloud,Enough already. I'll give you two gil for it.
Cloud,"Five then.Flower PeddlerPlease, that's not nearly enough. Besides, I clearly said it was on the—"
Cloud,"Look, I'm involved in things. Dangerous things."
Cloud,So keep your distance.
Cloud,"Hey, a mako reactor just blew. You shouldn't be out here trying to sell fl—"
Cloud,Are you blind...?
Cloud,Wha—Wait!
Cloud,Don't wanna stick around here.
Cloud,Gonna have to find a way around.
Cloud,So much for the direct route.
Cloud,"So much for the direct route. Find another way... Use the rooftops, maybe..."
Cloud,...But the rooftops look clear.
Cloud,Close call.
Cloud,It's all or nothing now...
Barret,On my go.
Barret,"Ugh, you had me worried for a minute..."
Barret,What the hell you been up to? Huh!?
Cloud,"Giving Public Security the runaround, that's what. Had to draw them away from the station somehow."
Cloud,Wait. Got a question for you all.
Barret,What?
Cloud,Ever been attacked by an invisible enemy?
Cloud,Wearing robes. Came and went like the wind.
Cloud,They were—at first. Only saw them after she grabbed me...
Barret,Hah! More like a panic-induced hallucination!
Cloud,Never mind. Forget I said anything.
Barret,"Suit yourself. C'mon, let's move up."
Barret,Lucky us. We've got a crowd to hide in. Head for the front of the train and hold there.
Cloud,Of course they are.
Cloud,"If you're about to ""unburden"" yourself—don't."
Cloud,I'm a SOLDIER.
Cloud,You get used to it.
Cloud,The explosion triggered a reaction with the mako. You said so yourself.
Cloud,Right.
Barret,Hey! Quit talking out your ass. Everyone knows Avalanche only cares about saving the planet.
Barret,A law-abiding concerned citizen.
Barret,"In my humble opinion, that explosion was a message—a message to the bastards bleeding our planet dry. Think they got it? Heard it loud and clear? Y'all's masters?"
Barret,Hmph. Them's fighting words.
Barret, Quit acting like a damn kid. I ain't in the mood.
Cloud,How many times do I have to tell you people. I'm not—
Barret,"Take a good look. It's because of that great big pizza in the sky that people down there gotta struggle to survive. Shinra sucks up mako while the soil turns to dust, the air fills with smog, and the flowers die."
Cloud,Then leave and don't look back. That's what's always worked for me.
Barret,"Hmph! Well, that's all well and good if you're only out for yourself. But the folks down there don't have the luxury of choice, you know?"
Cloud,"Like this train, I suppose... There's only one way it can go..."
Barret,"Hot damn, we are good!"
Barret,"Guys! Lower your voices, huh? People are listening."
Barret,"Now get some R&R. You've earned it. Just be ready for the next mission, alright?"
Barret,"See you soon. At Seventh Heaven? You know, where Tifa works? Don't keep her waiting. She'll worry."
Barret,"Not long now, honey! (laughs) Daddy's almost home!"
Cloud,You again...
Tifa,Marlene!
Barret,"That's right angel, I am! (laughs)"
Tifa,Welcome back!
Barret,Have you been a good girl?
Barret,"Oh you did, did you? Well, well...(laughs)"
Tifa,You made it.
Tifa,Where'd you get that? I can't remember the last time I saw a real one.
Tifa,How sweet. When did you get so thoughtful?
Cloud,A guy can change. Has been five years.
Tifa,Huh?
Cloud,I need to talk to Barret.
Tifa,Right. Come on in.
Barret,"Don't you worry about all that silliness. Daddy's here, and he's not going anywhere tonight. Now turn that thing off and let's get you to bed, huh?"
Tifa,Do you mind keeping Marlene company until I'm done with this?
Cloud,Me?
Tifa,"Yeah, you."
Barret,"Yeah, yeah, your money. Ask Tifa. She takes care of all that."
Barret,Hey! The hell you think you're doing scaring my daughter like that!?
Barret,"That's right, honey, I do say that. What a good girl you are, remembering Daddy's lessons. You know what else good girls do? They go to bed on time. C'mon."
Barret,Mmm...Alright—but just this once!
Tifa,"So, then! What can I get you?"
Cloud,My money. I'm still waiting on it.
Tifa,Ah... Right... About that... We should talk. Outside.
Barret,Of course.
Barret,Let that be a lesson to you.
Barret,"When you wanna talk to a little kid, don't go giving her the professional-killer eyes."
Tifa,"Before we get onto money... There's an empty apartment in a place just down the road. It's nothing fancy, but... I was thinking you could stay there for now. The landlady's a big friend of the cause, so you wouldn't even have to pay rent! Sound good?"
Cloud,Sure does. Thanks.
Tifa,Follow me then!
Tifa,How was it up on the plate?
Cloud,It was...chaotic.
Tifa,Sorry for dragging you into all this. It was wrong of me to put you in danger like that. I promise I won't do it again.
Cloud,Danger's part of the job. Don't worry about me.
Tifa,I'll try not to.
Cloud,Always happy to help stick it to Shinra.
Tifa,"So, you make nice with everyone?"
Cloud,"Much as I could, all things considered. Maybe not enough for them."
Tifa,Good. You had me worried. You're not exactly a people person.
Cloud,I'll give you that.
Tifa,I saw Sector 8 on the news... It was like a war zone...
Cloud,The news is just another Shinra mouthpiece. They'll spread whatever lies Shinra tells 'em to.
Tifa,So...it wasn't that bad?
Cloud,...It was.
Tifa,Oh. Right.
Tifa,And here we are. Good ol' Stargazer Heights. You're on the second floor.
Tifa,"Room 201 here is where I sleep. Don't have time for much else, what with Seventh Heaven and all. Not even time to decorate."
Tifa,"Here's your room—202. Don't worry, I already told the landlady about you."
Cloud,You did?
Tifa,"Yes? Ohhh, I mean I told her I had a friend looking for a place to stay. Was that too much?"
Cloud,No. It's fine. And this?
Tifa,"That one's, uh... Know what, it's getting late. I'll introduce you tomorrow."
Cloud,Wait a minute. That's Tifa's room. Don't be weird.
Cloud,What are you doing? You've never even meet this person.
Tifa,"It's a little bare, but should be enough to get you through the night. If you want anything else, we can always get it—"
Cloud,"There is one thing. My money. You guys owe me two thousand, remember?"
Tifa,"I do, and we'd love to settle up, especially since this was your first job for us, but..."
Cloud,That's it?
Tifa,"Sorry. We spent the rest preparing for the mission. That really is it. But not for long! I'm collecting money for filters tomorrow, so I can pay you after."
Cloud,(sighs) And you're sure about that?
Tifa,"Of course...as long as you help, that is. Wait... Then I'd have to pay you for that too. Never mind."
Cloud,"No, two thousand's enough. That's what we agreed on, so that'll be the price. With what you gave me, that leaves fifteen hundred."
Tifa,"You're the best! I'll see you bright and early at the bar, then. Thanks again for everything. Sleep tight!"
Cloud,Guess it's time for introductions.
Cloud,"What, you gonna wake her up?"
Cloud,Hey. You okay in there?
Cloud,Coming in.
Tifa,Cloud! Stop!
Cloud,Get back inside!
Cloud,Get off me!
Tifa,"What are you doing to Marco? This is his apartment. He's got a few problems, but he's not a bad guy. The landlady asked me to check on him now and then to make sure he's okay. Can I ask you to do the same?"
Cloud,Sure...
Cloud,I've been around.
Cloud,What's she to you?
Cloud,Loud and clear.
Tifa,Morning!
Cloud,Hey.
Tifa,"Just so you know, Marlene's still asleep."
Tifa,"Let's get down to business, shall we? These water filters won't replace themselves. Although, the next batch probably could, if Jessie put her mind to it. Most every home in the area has one. Folks love 'em 'cause they practically eliminate the rotten-egg smell. Honestly, they make us more money than this place. And it's easy money too. We bring new filters, collect the old ones, and get paid."
Tifa,What?
Cloud,Gimme a break. I'm not a salesman. I'm a SOLDIER.
Tifa,Which is why no one will refuse to pay. What do you say? Please?
Cloud,Let's get this over with.
Tifa,"Great. And while we're at it, I'll give you the grand tour."
Tifa,"Go ahead and keep whatever we collect. Seeing as you didn't bring any luggage, I'm guessing there's stuff you need to buy."
Cloud,Thanks.
Tifa,And don't worry. We'll pay you the difference after. Barret's out making his rounds too.
Cloud,As long as I get it all today.
Tifa,"Hey, there. Here to change out your water filter."
Tifa,Cloud's in charge of collections. He'll take your money.
Cloud,"In your dreams, maybe."
Tifa,"Cloud! Uh...since we're here, maybe we should do a little shopping?"
Cloud,Suppose I could take a look.
Tifa,"We'll see you around, okay? And let us know when your filter next needs changing!"
Tifa,He's a regular. Stock up here and he might throw in a freebie or two.
Cloud,For you maybe...
Tifa,Well... You could try being a little nicer.
Cloud,To get free shit? Not my style.
Tifa,(chuckles) Our next stop is Stargazer Heights. Landlady's a client.
Cloud,Just met her.
Tifa,"Then you know what to expect. Remember she's a good friend of Avalanche, so be nice. Please."
Tifa,"Hey, Marle! Got some filters for you."
Cloud,Working.
Tifa,Be nice! Cloud's helping me with collections.
Tifa,"I'm pretty good at taking care of myself, you know."
Cloud,I've got skills.
Tifa,Be nice!
Cloud,I'm doing my best...
Tifa,"A tried-and-true lesson for life on the ground floor, am I right?"
Tifa,"Thanks, Marle. You take care of yourself."
Tifa,Marle's great. She helped get me set up back in the day.
Cloud,You...been here a while now?
Tifa,"Five years, give or take... But never mind that! We've gotta get you your money! Last stop is the weapon store."
Tifa,We're so sorry about that. Hopefully this one will work better...
Tifa,"All right. If you could just settle your bill, we'll be on our way."
Tifa,My associate handles payment disputes...
Cloud,Pretty please.
Tifa,Thank you very much!
Tifa,"Seeing as we're done with our rounds, and you've got a small fortune now, why not take a gander at the weapons?"
Cloud,Well...when will Barret be back with the rest?
Tifa,"Before we open up tonight. It'll be a while yet, so...what do you wanna do?"
Cloud,Don't really know...
Tifa,"In that case, I've got a suggestion. Wanna hear it? If you're serious about becoming a merc, then you're going to need to start making connections. ""It's not what you know, but who you know,"" y'know?"
Cloud,Hmph. Another lesson for life on the ground floor?
Tifa,"Yep. Connections get you jobs, jobs build your rep, and more rep gets you better connections..."
Cloud,How do I start?
Tifa,"Hmm...why not help out the neighborhood watch? They're mostly volunteers, but you'll get to know people."
Cloud,"Yeah, okay."
Tifa,"Didn't see anybody at the office, so let's head up top."
Tifa,"Huh, didn't know you were holding down the fort."
Cloud,That depends. What does this neighborhood watch do?
Tifa,"Cloud's a great fighter, but only we know that. If no one knows him, no one'll hire him. Thought if he joined the watch, he could get his name out there."
Cloud,No thanks. It's fine just the way it is.
Cloud,Thanks.
Tifa,"Between him and Wedge, there isn't anyone they don't know."
Cloud,So...where are these monsters?
Tifa,"Hey, Cloud. I'll come with."
Cloud,"No, I've got this."
Tifa,"But...you don't know the way, do you?"
Cloud,Lead on.
Tifa,(chuckles) Sure thing. I know these streets better than anyone.
Tifa,"Scrap Boulevard is out west. Past the barricades supposed to keep the monsters out. Anyway, we should prepare, just in case."
Tifa,Here's Scrap Boulevard.
Cloud,I can see why monsters'd feel right at home.
Tifa,"Hm. And the more we pile up, the more they show up."
Tifa,"And there's our first challenger! Show me what you got, Cloud!"
Tifa,Wow... So that's what a SOLDIER looks line in action.
Cloud,This was just a warm-up.
Tifa,(chuckles) I'll bet. Let's keep at it!
Tifa,You're good at this! Charging in like it was nothing...
Cloud,You too. It's a little surprising.
Tifa,"Well, I've been here five years now. ""If you don't look out for yourself, no one else will."" By the way—that one's gonna be on the test."
Cloud,This a lesson?
Tifa,"Gotta learn if you're gonna stick around. Okay, let's wrap this up..."
Tifa,Alright. I think that might be the last of them.
Cloud,They won't stay gone for long...
Tifa,"Of course not. Even so, folks'll be grateful for the peace and quiet in the meantime. A win's a win, you know?"
Cloud,True.
Tifa,"Trust me—it'll do wonders for your rep. Right, let's go check in with Biggs and Wedge."
Cloud,Yeah.
Tifa,Got every last one too. Now the slums should be safe.
Cloud,So I heard. I've gotta ask though. What did you tell them?
Tifa,"It's alright. All you gotta do is keep up the good work. It'll pay off soon enough, I promise."
Cloud,Good.
Cloud,Yeah. We've been through a lot—
Tifa,You okay?
Cloud,I'm fine.
Tifa,Been meaning to ask... After you left the village...
Cloud,It's a long story.
Tifa,I've got time! Why don't you tell me all about it while we try to rustle up some more work for you?
Tifa,Sorry. Maybe next time.
Tifa,"Hey, before we get back to it, why don't you check out the weapons?"
Cloud,No need.
Tifa,"C'mon, the dealer's probably heard all about you by now. Might treat you better."
Cloud,I dunno about that...
Tifa,Word spreads fast around here.
Cloud,What if I am?
Cloud,Fine.
Cloud,Just a look.
Tifa,"Since you've got yourself a new weapon, let's see if we can't put it to good use. Come on. Let's go chat up Wymer."
Cloud,Who?
Tifa,The guy who tracks all the requests that come to the watch. You never know—could toss some work your way.
Cloud,Where's he at?
Tifa,"Oh, he should be back at the office by now."
Tifa,"Actually, I wanted to introduce you to an old friend of mine. This is Cloud. He's a merc."
Cloud,"I'll take on anything. For the right price, that is."
Cloud,Thanks.
Tifa,Something's wrong. Let's check it out.
Tifa,That went well. Could be you've found your calling.
Cloud,Eh. Was alright I guess.
Tifa,"Think of each job as an opportunity—not to make money, but to build connections."
Cloud,"""It's not what you know, but who."""
Tifa,(chuckles) You remembered.
Cloud,Had a patient teacher.
Tifa,Maybe not so patient next time.
Cloud,Hoo boy.
Tifa,"Oh, Barret should've finished collecting his share of the money by now, so what do you wanna do? Head back to the bar?"
Tifa,"I'll be a lot of people are talking about you right now. ""There's this amazing merc who can handle anything!"""
Cloud,Nothing I've done around here has been all that special though.
Tifa,"Oh, so you want more of a challenge, huh?"
Tifa,Okay then! That's another solid gig in the books! You know the whole town is really impressed with what you've done. Keep it up and you'll have enough work to keep you fed for a lifetime!
Cloud,All thanks to you.
Tifa,And don't you forget it!
Cloud,So where do we get paid? The shop or something?
Tifa,"Yeah, but why don't we head back to the apartments first? Take a quick breather."
Cloud,Which lesson was that again...?
Tifa,"Lesson one. Got it? Anyway, let's go!"
Cloud,I'm not interested in working for Shinra.
Cloud,I will hold you to that.
Cloud,There. That should be enough intel for the kid.
Cloud,Yeah.
Cloud,"I don't see any ""doomrats"" around..."
Tifa,"Hmm, what do you think? Should we wait? You know, this might be a waste of time. Let's head back to the store and touch base for now."
Cloud,"Yeah, sure."
Cloud,I'll handle it.
Cloud,Well...
Tifa,No.
Tifa,I know someone who can help you. This guy right here.
Cloud,I'm looking for cats?
Cloud,This sucks.
Cloud,"Ugh, screw this."
Cloud,I'll handle it.
Cloud,"Gotta say, I've never seen a Shinra breed like that before. Out of curiosity, when exactly did it show up?"
Cloud,Huh. Really...? That's news to me.
Cloud,It's a big organization. I'm sure there's lots of secrets I don't know.
Tifa,That the key?
Cloud,Yeah.
Cloud,They're just doing their jobs. Can't expect them to be at your beck and call.
Cloud,You need people who can follow orders too.
Tifa,Sure thing!
Cloud,...We're already friends.
Tifa,"Let's take care of this real quick, okay?"
Cloud,Sure.
Tifa,Come over when you're done.
Tifa,Gimme one sec. I'll be done in a bit.
Tifa,Finally!
Tifa,So. After you left the village.
Cloud,Hm?
Tifa,I let you off the hook before. Back at the hall. But not this time.
Cloud,"Well, when we were kids...everybody wanted to be a SOLDIER, right?"
Tifa,"Yeah, I remember they were on the news every day during the war."
Cloud,"Thing is, by the time I finally made it in, they didn't need heroes anymore. It was nothing like what we'd dreamt of. It was just...working for Shinra. Just..."
Tifa,I'm sorry. I know it's a touchy subject.
Cloud,Not exactly small talk. Especially with someone you haven't seen in a while.
Tifa,"I get it. Still, it's kinda funny. Us going our separate ways, thinking that must be it... that we'd never meet again—and then here of all places we do."
Tifa,You know what? We should totally celebrate! Let's dress up and hit the town!
Cloud,Really?
Tifa,"I mean, why not? It'll be fun!"
Cloud,Do you even have fancy clothes?
Tifa,"Not like fancy fancy, but I'll figure something out! What do you think would suit me, huh?"
Cloud,Something refined.
Tifa,"Yeah, I guess we're not kids anymore."
Cloud,Something...sporty?
Tifa,I don't think that'd be so different from my usual.
Cloud,Something exotic?
Tifa,"Uhhh...really? Then again, if we're making an effort..."
Tifa,"Be sure to pick an outfit that goes with mine, okay?"
Cloud,Will do.
Tifa,"(chuckles) This is gonna be so much fun, you'll see!"
Cloud,Yeah...maybe.
Tifa,"And on that happy note, I think it's time we headed back to the bar. C'mon!"
Cloud,"Uh, you don't need a break?"
Tifa,"Honestly, I'm feeling pretty good. Marle isn't always right you know."
Tifa,"Hey, Marle. We took care of the filters, so we're gonna head back to the bar now."
Tifa,Uh...I don't feel that different.
Tifa,What's going on?
Tifa,"We've gotta save him, Cloud!"
Cloud,Is he Avalanche?
Tifa,No. He doesn't really know what we do...but he has his suspicions. And... He's a talker.
Tifa,"Actually, you know what...maybe I should go alone."
Cloud,I'm coming.
Tifa,Uh...are you sure?
Cloud,It's the least I can do. Lead on.
Tifa,Thanks. Come on!
Tifa,Come on. Let's get a closer look.
Tifa,"I swear, all he had to do was keep his mouth shut."
Cloud,Yep.
Tifa,"Anyway, you distract the officers, and I'll...figure something out."
Cloud,Let him go.
Tifa,Here we go...
Tifa,Grab Johnny so we can get outta here.
Cloud,Alright.
Tifa,Wh—what now?
Cloud,He's a talker.
Tifa,No!
Cloud,"You wanna live, then get the hell out of town."
Cloud,Are you sure about this? It's a big risk.
Tifa,"I know, but...it's fine."
Cloud,And them?
Tifa,No more... Cloud... You're scaring me.
Tifa,We need to go before they wake up.
Tifa,I...I'm worried about Johnny.
Cloud,"I'm more worried about us. We gotta go, right?"
Tifa,Right...
Cloud,What?
Tifa,It's just...you've really changed.
Cloud,How?
Tifa,I suppose it's...yeah. Your eyes. They used to be less...
Cloud,"It's the mako. SOLDIER, remember?"
Tifa,"...I remember. So, what do you wanna do now? Head back to the bar? Or do you wanna tackle another job or two?"
Tifa,And here we are. You must be tired.
Cloud,"Same as you, I guess."
Tifa,"Could use a little something to take the edge off, right? How about a refreshing cocktail made by yours truly that you can sit back and savor?"
Cloud,Tifa...
Tifa,"Yeah, I'm feeling it a bit too. Hey... Do you think you'll stick around a little longer?"
Cloud,"Maybe. Work for a minute, build up some savings..."
Tifa,"I see. In that case, wanna head back out and look for more gigs?"
Cloud,"Yeah, why not."
Tifa,Well? You wanna head inside?
Tifa,We're back.
Tifa,Lotsa fun.
Barret,Hey—need y'all downstairs.
Tifa,Uh...right now? Then the plan is...?
Barret,"Marlene, wanna go wait for Jessie out front?"
Tifa,"Looks like we're officially on for tomorrow night, then. Gotta go over the details with the others."
Cloud,"Before you do, about my pay—"
Barret,"You'll get your money! So sit down and shut up until we're finished. Double time, Tifa."
Tifa,I'm really sorry...but it shouldn't take much longer. In the meantime... Grab a seat.
Tifa,What'll it be?
Cloud,I dunno...something hard and bitter.
Cloud,Not really in the mood right now.
Tifa,"But if you were, then maybe..."
Tifa,Well? Most people would say something sweet right about now.
Cloud,I'm sure they would.
Tifa,"Ahh, but you're a more discerning customer, aren't you? In which case..."
Tifa,Our house special the Cosmo Canyon.
Cloud,Beautiful.
Tifa,I gotta go. Enjoy.
Cloud,For the right price.
Cloud,Could still kill some time.
Cloud,What was up with that girl anyway?
Cloud,Maybe just chill a bit.
Cloud,I heard you're having second thoughts.
Tifa,I know we have to think big if we're going to make a difference. But not like this. I just... I feel trapped.
Cloud,"If it feels wrong, don't do it."
Tifa,"Guess that's that, then."
Cloud,"What, they kick you out?"
Tifa,We agreed to disagree. So—you want another drink?
Barret,Tifa! Time to celebrate! Break out all the good stuff!
Tifa,Oh. Sure.
Barret,We won't be needing you for this next job. Feel free to look for work elsewhere.
Cloud,"Fine by me. That's how I like it. No contract, no obligation."
Barret,"Figured you'd say that. Here—the rest of your payment, along with a little extra for your exemplary service. And thus concludes our business. Gonna have to ask you to leave now. This here's a private affair."
Cloud,It's fine.
Cloud,"Really, it's fine."
Barret,Keep it tight! Ain't no room for error come tomorrow!
Tifa,It's been too long since we did this.
Barret,"It was an ""amicable separation."""
Tifa,Can't believe it's already been a year. I don't know how we managed.
Barret,"Well, I do. It was you guys going above and beyond. Thank you."
Barret,"Yeah, but when shit hits the fan, it's good to know you're in my corner. End of the day...you're all I got!"
Barret,"As a friend, or as a cook?"
Tifa,I guess it is kinda obvious!
Barret,Oh we will. Avalanche!
Tifa,You guys...
Cloud,What's up with them?
Cloud,I guess.
Cloud,That depends...
Cloud,Five hundred.
Cloud,"Mm, three."
Cloud,I told you before... That depends.
Cloud,"Shinra's time, you mean?"
Cloud,Like I give a shit.
Cloud,"Big man with a big gun for an arm, right!?"
Cloud,Why do you want him?
Cloud,"So, if they weren't Shinra, then..."
Cloud,Not my problem. Lesson one for life on the ground floor... Get some rest.
Cloud,What've you got there?
Cloud,A proposition.
Cloud,Tonight?
Cloud,That's fine by me... But don't you have a pretty big day ahead of you?
Cloud,It's...just another job...
Cloud,No.
Cloud,Yeah.
Cloud,Because of all the mako. Isn't that what you said?
Cloud,Let's say you're right. So what?
Cloud,Shinra? Good luck with that.
Cloud,They'll come for us.
Cloud,SOLDIERs get mandatory training.
Cloud,Don't blame me if ya get sick.
Cloud,Of course not.
Cloud,Someone's having fun.
Cloud,Get off!
Cloud,Nope.
Cloud,Just you.
Cloud,Shut up!
Cloud,A-team's here.
Cloud,We're good.
Cloud,You got me.
Cloud,Keep going till we hit the station?
Cloud,A SOLDIER.
Cloud,You talking to me?
Cloud,Then no!
Cloud,Same shit. Being a dumbass.
Cloud,Had enough?
Cloud,"Jessie, take over."
Cloud,Maybe.
Cloud,What test?
Cloud,I'm great at driving.
Cloud,Not used to having any.
Cloud,Nope.
Cloud,What test?
Cloud,Did more than just passs.
Cloud,Whatever.
Cloud,Didn't want you to fall.
Cloud,"Just hold on tight, will you?"
Cloud,What?
Cloud,What test?
Cloud,Been driving for years.
Cloud,No.
Cloud,Ah. Okay.
Cloud,"Once the lights come on, it's go time."
Cloud,Time to go.
Cloud,This isn't it.
Cloud,Jessie...
Cloud,What's this?
Cloud,Jessie Rasberry as...the Princess?
Cloud,Thanks.
Cloud,Time to go.
Cloud,Need to hurry up.
Cloud,Mission accomplished.
Cloud,This it?
Cloud,Diversion.
Cloud,How much time do you think you'll need?
Cloud,Yeah.
Cloud,"No, I wanna hear it."
Cloud,Just that I understand how you feel. Unlike most of the time.
Cloud,Well... No promises.
Cloud,Not my problem.
Cloud,Wait. Where are the guards?
Cloud,It won't.
Cloud,I can handle this solo.
Cloud,Don't expect me to save you.
Tifa,Heya. So...what did you wanna talk about?
Tifa,Should've figured. All the guys are leaving.
Tifa,"The great war hero, huh? Mm... Isn't it pretty hard to become a SOLDIER?"
Tifa,Guess not. Think you'll be in the papers?
Tifa,"Just...promise me one thing. When we're older, and you're a famous SOLDIER...if I'm ever trapped or in trouble... Promise you'll come and save me."
Tifa,That's what heroes do. They save people. Please? Just once.
Tifa,"Come on, promise me!"
Tifa,I know we have to think big if we're going to make a difference...but not like this. I just... I feel trapped.
Cloud,Let's go.
Cloud,Give up?
Cloud,You ready?
Cloud,Fall back.
Cloud,Satisfied?
Cloud,Goddammit!
Cloud,Let's go!
Cloud,Wedge!
Cloud,"And who are ""they""?"
Cloud,So then why are they here?
Cloud,You tell me.
Cloud,Right.
Cloud,Security's out in force.
Cloud,"So, are we not gonna wait for Wedge?"
Cloud,Why's that?
Cloud,We'll go get him.
Cloud,It's not safe here. We should go.
Cloud,Coincidence?
Cloud,Yeah...m-me too. For your dad's sake.
Cloud,That's...that's right...
Cloud,Yep.
Cloud,No.
Cloud,I ain't your bro.
Cloud,You did enough. You took one for the team. Be proud.
Cloud,"It's cool, we'll go together."
Cloud,Cut that out.
Cloud,I guess.
Cloud,Sure.
Cloud,Guess not.
Cloud,Wouldn't've guessed.
Cloud,Hmm...
Cloud,Huh.
Cloud,They know about Jessie and Avalanche?
Cloud,You lost me.
Cloud,Okay...
Cloud,Really sorry about your ass.
Cloud,It's kinda weird when you call me th—
Cloud,Hell with it...
Cloud,"Uh, who's the gang?"
Cloud,Right...
Cloud,"Okay, I get it. Mind letting me breathe?"
Cloud,Are you seriously that desperate? Just let go already.
Cloud,"No promises, but I'll think it over."
Cloud,Never heard of any of that stuff.
Cloud,Not happening.
Cloud,Bad idea...
Cloud,He's fine.
Cloud,Biggs.
Cloud,Biggs!
Cloud,Get some rest. You need it.
Cloud,Night.
Cloud,She's probably asleep.
Tifa,Cloud?
Cloud,Yeah.
Tifa,You were out for a while.
Cloud,Just walking.
Tifa,"I ran into Johnny, by the way. Said not to worry, he was getting out of town."
Cloud,"Oh, that guy."
Tifa,"You...weren't thinking of leaving Midgar anytime soon, were you?"
Cloud,"Well, seems this old friend of mine's in a tight spot... Long time ago I said I'd be there for her. Made a promise, so..."
Tifa,Can't say this is quite what I had in mind when I put that on you way back when.
Cloud,"If you wanna talk, I'm listening."
Tifa,Huh? What's with you all of a sudden?
Cloud,With me?
Tifa,Like you're losing that hard edge.
Cloud,That bad?
Tifa,Not at all—I like it. Maybe Marlene won't be so scared of you next time...
Tifa,"(chuckles) I'm really glad to have you back, Cloud. Really glad."
Tifa,"It's pretty late, huh? I'd like to catch up more, but we should probably both get some sleep, yeah?"
Cloud,Yeah.
Tifa,Good night then.
Cloud,"Good night, Tifa..."
Tifa,Cloud!
Cloud,What's wrong?
Tifa,Come with me! Quickly!
Tifa,We were getting ready to set out when those things showed up and came after us!
Cloud,The others?
Tifa,"Barret and Jessie are holding their ground, but for how long I don't know..."
Cloud,Let's go.
Tifa,Right.
Cloud,Ready?
Tifa,You know it!
Cloud,Let's head for the bar.
Tifa,Okay!
Cloud,Is this even working?
Cloud,We kill it?
Cloud,There's no end to this.
Tifa,What are these things?
Cloud,No idea. Pretty sure you can't even see them unless they make physical contact first...
Tifa,And that's all you can tell me?
Cloud,I can tell you they're not invincible.
Tifa,I guess that's something.
Tifa,More of them!? We're running out of time.
Cloud,Any other way?
Tifa,Yeah—over here!
Cloud,Again?
Tifa,Are they trying to stop us from reaching the others?
Tifa,Cloud. This way.
Tifa,"Oh, you gotta be kidding me. It's like trying to fight a hurricane."
Cloud,Stay on your feet.
Tifa,You don't have to tell me that.
Barret,Gimme a break!
Tifa,Jessie! Barret!
Barret,Where you been!?
Tifa,Hang on!
Cloud,Tifa!
Tifa,Cloud!
Cloud,I'm coming!
Cloud,Move!
Tifa,What is it doing now?
Cloud,Be careful.
Tifa,"So this thing's not gonna give up without a fight, huh?"
Barret,How's your ammo?
Tifa,Jessie!
Barret,Dammit!
Tifa,Huh?
Cloud,The hell...?
Barret,Jessie!
Tifa,You okay?
Tifa,Easy now!
Barret,We ain't putting on a damn show!
Barret,"The hell were those things? Some kind of...I dunno! Guess I shouldn't be surprised, though. Never can tell what weird shit'll come crawling out of the scrap down here. It's those reactors, I'm telling you..."
Cloud,It hurt?
Cloud,It happens.
Tifa,"Still, I think you ought to avoid putting any—"
Barret,"That's enough! You're out, Jessie."
Barret,"Nah, we got this..."
Barret,Okay... So here's the thing...
Cloud,I'm gonna need a raise.
Barret,Consider it done!
Barret,"Aight, everyone—Cloud's in. The mission is on!"
Barret,"Listen, Wedge—I need you to hang back and guard the home front."
Barret,Which makes you the perfect choice to look after Jessie and Marlene.
Barret,"Let's get this show on the road... to Mako Reactor 5! Once you've got your gear in order, head to the station for the meet. Got it?"
Barret,"This'll help you get squared away. Don't tell me I never did nothing for ya. I'm counting on you, SOLDIER boy..."
Cloud,There's always next time.
Tifa,"Alright, let's get going."
Cloud,Sure...after you take a deep breath.
Tifa,Huh?
Cloud,I can tell you're nervous.
Tifa,"That obvious, huh?"
Tifa,Okay. I'm ready now.
Barret,"Alright, people. Mission starts the moment we board that train. You sure you ready for this?"
Barret,"Well then, what're you waiting for!? Finish up so we can get going."
Tifa,Do you think Biggs is...on schedule?
Barret,All we can do is hope...
Cloud,"Today really gotta be the day, huh?"
Barret,"Ain't no stopping this train we're on, son. A lotta people risked their lives to get it rolling... Already put the word out more's coming, too... ""Shut them all down by today, or we shut another down for you."" Ain't on us. Not us..."
Barret,Play it cool.
Barret,"The target's Mako Reactor 5. From the station, we take the backstreets. Once we're inside the facility, it's the same deal as last time."
Cloud,Head for mako storage.
Barret,And then blow it all to hell.
Barret,Let's do this one for Jessie and Wedge. They deserve it.
Tifa,Yeah.
Cloud,Sure.
Tifa,I didn't think word would spread this fast. There's barely anyone on this train. And none of them look happy to be here.
Barret,Might stand out as a group. You two stay here.
Tifa,Cloud.
Tifa,Here comes the first hurdle...
Cloud,Not much of one.
Tifa,"I know, I know. But that doesn't mean I don't have butterflies in my stomach."
Tifa,"Hey, would you mind keeping an eye on things the next car over? I'm worried there might be trouble."
Cloud,Why's that?
Tifa,"Barret's always on edge before missions, but you know he's a good guy underneath it all. The people on this train don't."
Cloud,He'll be fine.
Tifa,Maybe...but I won't be until I know for sure.
Cloud,(sighs) Be right back.
Tifa,Thanks.
Barret,Heh. Is that right?
Barret,"Do I have a problem with that? Oh, you can bet—"
Cloud,He doesn't.
Barret,Hmph. Asshole...
Cloud,You know you're better than that.
Barret,"(hums ""Victory Fanfare"")"
Tifa,No way!
Tifa,Not good!
Barret,Get over here! Now!
Tifa,"Take care of them, Cloud!"
Cloud,On it.
Tifa,You have to get to the next car!
Barret,"Keep moving, people!"
Barret,Get to car two!
Barret,You wanna survive this? Then move!
Tifa,Cloud!
Barret,Move it!
Cloud,Dammit.
Tifa,Just go! How many are there!?
Barret,We gotta jump...
Cloud,Tifa... Barret...
Tifa,Please! You have to get out of here!
Tifa,Trying to keep you alive.
Tifa,I don't care. I don't want anyone to die. Please!
Tifa,My turn!
Cloud,There's no end to them...
Barret,"Looks like you're right, SOLDIER boy."
Cloud,Screw this.
Barret,Huh?
Cloud,The station will be crawling with security. We gotta jump.
Barret,Screw that!
Cloud,Need to slow the train down.
Barret,Sounds like a Biggs plan E.
Barret,"Okay, y'all watch and learn. I'm gonna jump. Gonna do it. Gonna show you how it's done!"
Cloud,Tifa!
Cloud,You okay?
Tifa,Yeah...
Cloud,"Alright, you ready?"
Tifa,Ready.
Tifa,That's gotta be him!
Tifa,"Hey, thanks. For when we jumped from the train, I mean."
Cloud,"No biggie. You're pretty light, you know."
Tifa,You always know what to say.
Cloud,Where are they?
Cloud,Tifa!
Tifa,They just won't quit!
Tifa,Whew! Thanks for the assist!
Cloud,Glad to see you're okay. So—where's Barret?
Tifa,"Somewhere over there, I think."
Tifa,"After Barret jumped, I knew I had to go right after, but..."
Cloud,Don't worry about it.
Tifa,"Cool as ever, I see."
Cloud,"If I wasn't, they would've never made me a SOLDIER."
Tifa,Good point.
Tifa,He's close! Come on!
Tifa,There! Barret!
Barret,Tifa! Could use some help here!
Tifa,We're coming!
Barret,Make it quick! Should be some stairs over there!
Tifa,We'd better hurry.
Cloud,Yeah.
Barret,I've had it up to here with you damn robo-bugs! I'm gonna rip off those spindly legs of yours one by one!
Barret,I ain't going down without a fight!
Tifa,That doesn't sound good!
Cloud,Let's go.
Tifa,Barret!
Barret,Great! Gimme a hand!
Barret,"This calls for a song! Duhn-duhn-duhn-duhn, duhn duhn, duhn-da-duhn!"
Tifa,That's gotta be the last of them...right?
Barret,"Aw, who cares? We can take 'em! Now let's confirm our position and get back on mission! That reactor's waiting!"
Barret,Looks like it's gonna be plan E.
Cloud,Go on.
Barret,"Plan A was if everything went off without a stitch. From the station, it would've been a straight shot to the reactor. Didn't work out, but we knew going in we had to have alternatives. Backup plans, 'case we had to get off early."
Barret,"From closer in to further out—B, C, D, and so on."
Cloud,Up to what?
Tifa,... To E.
Cloud,Lucky us...
Barret,(laughs) You're damn right!
Tifa,"Anyway, we were riding the train between Sector 4 and the main pillar when we had to bail out. And we ended up on the adjacent line, which should take us to Reactor 5."
Barret,"That's right. So for now we follow the tracks. Not too far, though. Need to switch to a different route before we hit the station. 'Cause you can bet your ass it's gonna be crawling with security—all on high alert."
Tifa,Let's move.
Barret,"Our friends in Sector 5 marked the route, so don't worry about getting lost. It's a straight shot to victory, people! All we gotta do...is take it!"
Tifa,The reactor's the other way.
Barret,You got any sense of direction at all?
Barret,"You wanna keep going this way, you best explain yourself."
Tifa,I think the reactor's in the other direction.
Barret,"When the time comes, remember we just gotta follow the nose."
Cloud,What?
Tifa,Stamp's nose.
Barret,"We look for graffiti, then head in whichever direction its nose points. But pay attention to railway signals too. You see blue lights, you're going the right way."
Barret,Follow the blue lights and we'll reach the reactor.
Barret,"You gotta check the signals, son. The signals!"
Barret,"Biggs is way ahead of us. Jessie was gonna back him up, so it wouldn't surprise me if he needs our help. So let's not keep him waiting."
Tifa,Right.
Barret,There's one.
Barret,The hell you off to?
Barret,In nose we trust.
Tifa,"Good things our colleagues put up all that Stamp graffiti. Without it, we'd be lost for sure."
Tifa,What's that?
Barret,Nothing good.
Tifa,Guys...I think it might be a nest!
Barret,"All kinds of creepy-crawlies make themselves at home in the plate, then get messed up even more by the mako."
Tifa,Mako did this?
Barret,No. Not mako. Shinra.
Barret,What?
Cloud,That black-and-white world of yours.
Barret,"Ya like it, huh? You know there's room for one more."
Cloud,I'll think about it.
Barret,That's disgusting!
Tifa,More of 'em!?
Barret,What is this? A science experiment!?
Barret,What now!?
Tifa,It's huge!
Barret,"So you must be the queen, huh!?"
Barret,I ain't no exterminator. Why I gotta kill all these nasty-ass bugs?
Tifa,Those things really creep me out.
Barret,A train's gonna get derailed by 'em one of these days.
Tifa,Shinra should do something.
Barret,After an accident they will.
Tifa,When it's too late then.
Barret,There's good ol' Stamp. Check his nose.
Tifa,"This isn't bad, y'know..."
Barret,"Yeah, they really captured the essence of corporate propaganda."
Tifa,Check it out. I guess Shinra's doing something about those monsters after all.
Barret,Doing a half-assed job looks like.
Barret,Alright. Let's figure out where the hell we are.
Barret,Where you going!?
Barret,There's an old rail yard not far from here. What we're looking for's somewhere inside.
Cloud,And that is...?
Barret,A secret passageway.
Barret,Gotta love the irony of Shinra's smarmy lapdog leading the way to its master's destruction.
Barret,"We're going to the rail yard, remember?"
Tifa,"Just so you know, this way leads to the station, not the rail yard."
Barret,I told you this ain't the right way!
Tifa,"You really don't like Stamp, do you, Barret?"
Barret,It's not that I hate him. I hate the fact Shinra took a loyal animal like that and co-opted it for their own self-serving agenda.
Tifa,Poor old Stamp.
Barret,Starting to remind me of one Marlene's picture books. The one that's full of nothing but mazes...
Tifa,Think you're making progress and then you hit a wall.
Cloud,Knock it down.
Tifa,You're starting to sound like Barret.
Cloud,Never mind.
Barret,It's a good plan!
Barret,Hey! Hold up! This way.
Tifa,Security is a lot tighter than I thought it would be.
Barret,"If they wanna stand between us and the rail yard, that's their choice."
Barret,No getting through that gate! Let's take the stairs.
Barret,"We should be reaching that secret passage real soon. I knew plan E wouldn't fail us. Shoulda called it ""plan excellent""! Whatcha think, Mister Ex-SOLDIER?"
Cloud,"Biggs made the plan, right?"
Barret,I provided some input.
Cloud,Hope not too much.
Barret,What's that s'posed to mean?
Tifa,Thought this place was abandoned.
Barret,Guess not.
Tifa,So many guards.
Barret,Too many...
Barret,Keep looking for faithful little Stamp. He'll lead us to the passageway.
Cloud,This it?
Cloud,Get back!
Tifa,What the—!?
Barret,That all you got!?
Cloud,Someone's mad.
Barret,"Take your best shot, asshole!"
Cloud,Huh. Looks like an old model.
Barret,So it's an antique.
Cloud,"Don't underestimate it. It's slow, but it hits hard."
Barret,The hell—!? Tough bastard.
Tifa,What do we do?
Cloud,Aim for its legs. Bring it down.
Barret,"I think you've got its attention, Cloud!"
Cloud,I'll draw its fire. You two stay on the offensive.
Tifa,I think it hates me.
Barret,"Hah, look at that! It's tough being Mr. Popular."
Tifa,Not again!
Tifa,"Hey, see that?"
Cloud,That's its heart—a mako generator.
Barret,I'm guessin' we aim for that!
Tifa,What are those?
Cloud,More drones.
Tifa,Get out of our way!
Cloud,Bastards.
Barret,Damn! Think we gotta take these down first.
Barret,This is where I shine!
Barret,That it!?
Tifa,Now what?
Cloud,Could be a system error.
Barret,Thing's probably busted!
Barret,What's it doing now?
Tifa,I think—
Cloud,Get away from the tracks!
Cloud,It can electrify the tracks.
Cloud,Watch out for the surge!
Barret,Shit! It's still going!
Tifa,Now what?
Cloud,Destroy the pilot! That'll expose the generator!
Cloud,All clear.
Barret,And stay down!
Cloud,Let's go.
Tifa,Sure.
Barret,"Alright, this way."
Barret,The passage is beyond these shipping containers. Let's slip through 'em.
Barret,Talk about a tight squeeze...
Tifa,You okay?
Barret,Yeah...
Tifa,"So, you bump into any giant robots like that in Reactor 1?"
Barret,"Yeah, except the bastard looked like a scorpion! Speaking of which...what would you say that last one looked like?"
Tifa,Huh? Uh... Well...
Cloud,Looks dead now.
Barret,Lo and behold.
Barret,All aboard...
Barret,Just so you know...it's not gonna get any easier.
Cloud,When did it ever?
Barret,Through here and straight on to Reactor 5.
Tifa,You make it sound so simple...
Barret,Only 'cause it is. That there's the reactor support pillar.
Cloud,So what's the plan?
Barret,"After plan E comes F, G, and then H!"
Cloud,Thought E was the last.
Tifa,This here is Section F.
Barret,We cut through Section G and head for H.
Tifa,A cargo platform in H will get us closer to the reactor. Biggs should be somewhere over there.
Tifa,Looks like the sun's going down on Midgar...
Barret,Right. Double time! We got a date with a reactor.
Barret,Nothing but air below us.
Cloud,Shut up and move.
Tifa,"Just don't look down, okay?"
Barret,Easy for you to say.
Barret,"Section G's through here, huh?"
Cloud,This a switch for the lamp?
Tifa,This oughta open it.
Tifa,No good?
Cloud,"Needs power, I think."
Barret,That looks more like what we need...
Cloud,Control room.
Tifa,Let's check it out.
Barret,Hey. You see something over there?
Tifa,Maybe the gate didn't budge because there's not enough power to spare?
Barret,Gotta figure this out.
Tifa,Maybe no one uses that entrance.
Barret,I'm getting the feeling no one's come down here for a long time.
Tifa,"No ""plate inspectors,"" huh."
Cloud,Of course.
Tifa,"Hey guys, look at this. Instructions for dealing with a power shortage."
Cloud,"Kill the lights, and we free up power for the gate and other stuff."
Tifa,"""Sun lamps""... You think these are the plate suns? The closest thing we have to the real thing."
Barret,"Gotta put out a sun just to open a gate, huh?"
Tifa,"But if we go through with it, the grounders in Sector 4 will suffer..."
Barret,Now or later—sun's going out for good once we blow the reactor.
Tifa,That's true.
Cloud,Let's go.
Tifa,All these lamps... You'd think they'd be able to balance the load by now though.
Barret,Maybe. If the maintenance guys or whoever weren't playing hooky.
Tifa,"The lamps are important, but when you think about how much mako it must take to keep them running..."
Tifa,"That's gotta be one. Man, look at the size of it."
Barret,"That a console I see near the top of that ladder? A, uh, pretty tall ladder too."
Cloud,I'll go.
Tifa,Okay. We'll wait down here.
Barret,Okay! That's that.
Tifa,"Great job, Cloud!"
Barret,Next stop Section G!
Tifa,"Yep! And after that, Reactor 5!"
Tifa,Not again...
Barret,"Great. I'm sure those things'll welcome us just as warmly as before. Tell you what, the rot runs deep in this damn pizza."
Barret,"Don't mind us, y'all—just passing through!"
Cloud,If only.
Cloud,No way to cross that.
Tifa,Gotta go where the catwalks take us.
Tifa,They busted?
Cloud,"Powered down, is my guess."
Barret,"Lucky us, am I right? One less thing for us to worry about."
Barret,Filling the air that we gotta breathe with their shit.
Tifa,Monsters sure seem to like it. What's up with that?
Barret,It's like in the tunnels. They get twisted by the mako. But it all goes back to Shinra.
Barret,You know the best way to not get lost is to believe that you're not. Mind over matter.
Tifa,Isn't that from one of Marlene's books?
Barret,"Yup, one of her favorites! Loves it when I read it to her before bedtime, doing all the voices."
Tifa,"""Life in the Endless Maze,"" am I right? (chuckles) I remember."
Tifa,You okay?
Cloud,Yeah.
Barret,"Hah. Going for that materia, weren't you?"
Tifa,"So close, and yet so far. This path's no good now."
Barret,I'm sure there's another way to get there.
Tifa,Hm... Nothing we can do but search.
Barret,"And when we find it, we can finally snag that materia."
Tifa,"Hey, let's take a moment to get our bearings."
Barret,"We're still in G, right?"
Tifa,"Yeah. And to reach Mako Reactor 5, we need to go through Section H."
Cloud,Okay.
Tifa,"Unfortunately, I didn't spot a connecting catwalk to Section H. Did you?"
Barret,"Well, we can always do another lap."
Cloud,"Go for ten, why don'tcha."
Tifa,The only other route that I can think of would be...
Cloud,Along the wall.
Tifa,"Up for giving it a try? It might not work out, but it's the only idea I've got."
Cloud,It's not a bad one.
Barret,So we're shooting for those giant fans over there? Okay. At least we've got a clear landmark to guide us.
Tifa,Those ventilation fans?
Barret,Keeping the plate's air clean by pushing the smog into the slums. Whole system's designed to make shit roll downhill faster.
Tifa,You lost?
Tifa,"Hey, look! I think we can climb onto that pipe!"
Cloud,Sure seems that way.
Barret,Dammit.
Barret,"I feel no fear...yeah, no fear...no fear...no fear...no fear...no fear—little fear!"
Barret,"Hey guys, uh...you know, these fans are really loud and..."
Cloud,You chickening out?
Barret,Hell no! I'm just worried that your bony ass is gonna get blown off the side and shit!
Tifa,Enough. We gotta keep moving.
Barret,O-okay then! Follow me!
Barret,"No worse than a windy day, huh?"
Tifa,One with a tornado warning maybe. Don't look at the fan! Whatever you do!
Barret,Right.
Tifa,Made it through in one piece.
Barret,"Think that took a couple years off my life. I—I mean, uh, not really! Couple seconds maybe. Three tops!"
Tifa,"Section H is just up ahead! Slow and steady, guys."
Cloud,And that's our objective?
Tifa,"The cargo platform? Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the one."
Tifa,"Hey, what's that behind the fan over there?"
Cloud,Isn't that—
Barret,Hey! Don't be a dumbass! Tifa told you not to look at the fan!
Barret,This is it. The cargo platform Biggs was talking about. Let's not keep him waiting.
Barret,You're kidding me.
Cloud,"Needs three light's worth, looks like."
Tifa,"But that's... That's all of them, isn't it?"
Barret,All or nothing...
Tifa,Let's regroup here if we get lost. Remember the H-01 sign.
Cloud,Right.
Barret,Lessee now... Closest light oughta be...
Cloud,That one.
Tifa,"""By the light of these magnificent lamps... we shall lead our brothers and sisters of the undercity to a brighter future."""
Barret,Say what?
Tifa,It's from a speech President Shinra gave talking about the importance of the sun lamps.
Barret,"Brighter future, my ass. Shinra's leading us down a one-way path to darkness and death."
Cloud,Gotta power down a sun lamp first.
Tifa,Look! There's the switch.
Barret,Let's flip it and go.
Tifa,That's one down.
Barret,Only two more lights to go.
Tifa,"""Intrusion prevention""?"
Cloud,Back online 'cause of us.
Barret,"No need to fret, y'all. A few rusted mechs ain't gonna keep us from reaching the reactor."
Cloud,"Mid-range turrets, huh?"
Barret,"Hey, Cloud! Hang back while I deal with these pests."
Tifa,Just made our lives a lot harder.
Cloud,"We restored power to more than just security, remember?"
Tifa,We can move this catwalk!
Barret,Think back. Anybody see a connecting catwalk?
Barret,Which way to the next light?
Tifa,If we can't make sense of this place we're gonna get lost.
Barret,Well at least we know where the big-ass things are.
Barret,And that makes two lights down.
Tifa,Meaning we've only got one left.
Barret,"The end's in sight, y'all!"
Cloud,Should be able to climb down from here.
Barret,"This'll hold, right?"
Cloud,That the Sector 4 slums down there?
Tifa,Huh? You wanna check them out sometime? I can show you around.
Barret,We'll check them out now if we fall!
Tifa,You think they'll miss those three plate suns?
Barret,I say the real sun's the only one we need! To hell with Shinra and their night-lights.
Tifa,We're right back where we started. Hmm... Where was that last light again?
Tifa,Almost done. It's a shame we had to wander around so much.
Barret,Well. No Stamps here to guide us. No Jessie or Wedge to back us up neither.
Tifa,"Yeah... Speaking of which, what should we tell Biggs? I don't want him to worry."
Barret,"Uhh, you takin' a detour? Well, aight then."
Barret,"If there's no viable path, we'll just have to make one."
Tifa,And that makes three. Enough to finally get our cargo platform moving.
Cloud,Better be.
Barret,Okay! Let's head on back to the H-01 sign.
Tifa,I hope that Jessie's injury isn't anything serious.
Barret,The best thing you can do to speed her recovery is to kick Shinra ass in her stead.
Tifa,I know. I know. And Cloud's gotta cover for Wedge too.
Cloud,When do we link up with Biggs?
Barret,"Soon enough, don't you worry."
Tifa,"He knew we might be late, so he came up with a few ways to kill time."
Barret,Oughta reach him long before he dies of boredom.
Tifa,And we're back at the cargo platform.
Barret,"Get ready, Mako Reactor 5. We're coming."
Barret,"So long, underplate. I hate you too."
Tifa,We need to disable a lamp first.
Barret,Where could they be going...? Embarking on an adventure to find some treasure!?
Cloud,Does this control the fans?
Tifa,We stop it?
Barret,"Man, what are we even doing?"
Cloud,Okay.
Barret,What?
Barret,This is summoning materia!
Tifa,Wow...
Barret,What kind of badass will pop outta this one?
Cloud,We'll see.
Tifa,Wonder what the reactor's like.
Barret,Dark. Dismal. A slaughterhouse where they butcher the planet. Then there's the smell. The mako. Be ready for it.
Tifa,Right...
Barret,"Hear that, guys? It's the reactor calling us. Beckoning us, saying ""Bring it on, Avalanche."""
Tifa,"Even after all that fighting, no one's coming for us?"
Cloud,No need. This is Shinra's city. They probably have cameras everywhere.
Tifa,Why didn't you say something sooner?
Cloud,Way too late to bail now.
Barret,"It's like walking a tightrope. When you're on it, only two ways off."
Tifa,Better keep my balance.
Cloud,You'd be good at it.
Tifa,I wonder.
Cloud,Tifa?
Tifa,It's nothing. Just thinking about the next step. Didn't think I'd be this nervous.
Barret,Some things you never get used to.
Tifa,Yeah.
Barret,Report.
Barret,"You magnificent son of a bitch, bring it in!"
Tifa,Jessie got hurt and couldn't make it.
Barret,Not so bad she couldn't rope in this guy.
Cloud,It's a jump.
Barret,Little dark and foreboding for my taste...
Barret,Ready to take on the world and then some!
Tifa,"Make sure everyone gets clear, okay?"
Barret,"Okay, y'all. Keep these grappling guns close. Secure 'em to your belt or whatever so you don't lose 'em. When we're done, we'll be using these babies to get down safe. All of us."
Cloud,Got it.
Barret,That's it. That's the smell. This place reeks of mako.
Tifa,Looks like we made it.
Barret,Layout's the same as Reactor 1?
Cloud,Yeah. We're near mako storage.
Barret,Let's move.
Barret,I'm not seeing a way down...
Tifa,Here maybe?
Barret,Well now! That could work.
Barret,I'm next.
Tifa,"Kinda scary, huh?"
Cloud,S'all in the mind.
Barret,"Hey! Check it out. They sic this big boy on us, we'd be screwed six ways from Sunday."
Cloud,"Mechanized units like these were designed to take out giant monsters. Probably a new prototype. If they do decide to deploy it, then our best bet would be to run like hell."
Barret,Then let's hope he sleeps through the explosion.
Tifa,Where is everybody?
Barret,"You mean Shinra? Got spooked and cleared out, is my guess."
Tifa,Almost there...
Tifa,The smell... It takes me back...
Tifa,Guys!
Barret,"Well, well! What we got here!?"
Cloud,Turrets up top.
Barret,I can deal with those things!
Tifa,So...it was like this last time?
Barret,Little more chaotic—ain't that right?
Cloud,Yeah.
Barret,Hey! SOLDIER boy!
Cloud,Tifa—
Tifa,What?
Cloud,How much time we need?
Barret,Got all the time in the world. This one comes with a remote detonator.
Tifa,Courtesy of Jessie.
Barret,We withdraw to a safe distance—then...kaboom!
Cloud,"""Safe"" distance?"
Barret,What? No such thing?
Barret,We get out the same way we got in. Let's double back.
Barret,What the—Where you goin'!?
Cloud,Weirdly perfect timing.
Tifa,Wait a minute. Is someone watching us?
Barret,The chief warmonger.
Tifa,What is this!?
Barret,The big boy!
Barret,Shhh.
Barret,Shut the hell up!
Tifa,I don't believe it... We played right into Shinra's hands!
Barret,Yeah. And their bullshit news is already peddling their false narrative.
Tifa,So we're screwed.
Barret,No no no no no! Hell no! Listen! They wanna turn this into a spectacle? Then I say let's give 'em one! Let's take down Shinra's big-ass mech in front of everybody!
Cloud,Okay. I'm sold.
Barret,All clear! Now let's see what these bastards were up to...
Tifa,"Barret, Cloud! Over here!"
Barret,Huh? Find something?
Cloud,Keycard. Might come in handy.
Barret,You think!? Nice work!
Tifa,"You really that impatient, Cloud?"
Tifa,It looks like a few of its components are still in transit...
Barret,(chuckles) We'll see about that.
Cloud,Could tamper a little with its loadout...
Tifa,And give ourselves an edge?
Cloud,There should be a console somewhere...
Barret,This the console you talking about?
Barret,Think you can get it to work?
Cloud,Needs a keycard.
Barret,"Well, let's find it then!"
Barret,Try that keycard of yours.
Tifa,You find it?
Cloud,Yeah.
Barret,"Good job! Now, let's check out that console."
Tifa,"""M units,"" huh? I'm guessing that's some sort of component?"
Cloud,Yep. An enhancement powered by liquefied materia.
Barret,Sounds bad.
Cloud,Pretty sure I can divert this unit for disposal.
Barret,What the hell? You got a better plan or something?
Tifa,So far so good.
Barret,Right. Let's move!
Tifa,You think they're watching us? Even now?
Cloud,Yep. Probably got a live feed.
Barret,Nothing we can do about it...'cept smile for the folks at home.
Tifa,Looks like there's two consoles this time.
Barret,Hah! Double the sabotage!
Cloud, If we can find the keycards.
Tifa,Any cards?
Cloud,Just the one.
Tifa,"Two choices, and only one single-use card... It's up to you, Cloud."
Barret,Console talks about big bomber shells. You acquainted?
Cloud,We called 'em BBs. One's enough to blow you to hell and back.
Barret,Could divert them and give it a couple less shots to take out.
Tifa,"What does an ""AI programming core"" do?"
Cloud,Increases processing power dedicated to motor function computation. Makes it move real quick.
Tifa,"A ""real quick"" giant robot, huh? That doesn't sound good. Anyway, we should weigh our options carefully."
Tifa,"So, where did we send the discarded stuff?"
Cloud,"To a storeroom for defective equipment, I'm guessing."
Barret,That so... You think these defective shells and programming cores might be valuable enough to warrant a little...detour?
Cloud,Maybe.
Barret,I say we grab 'em.
Cloud,Hmph. If we get that far.
Barret,"Okay! Listen up, y'all! Everything Shinra has told you is a goddamn lie! Mako is the lifeblood of our planet! Those greedy bastards are bleeding it dry! Y'all gotta rise up—"
Tifa,Barret!? Who are you talking to?
Barret,"The people! Put me on TV, I'mma drop some truth!"
Cloud,Thousand gil says they cut the sound.
Barret,Piece o' cake!
Tifa,Find any cards?
Cloud,Only one. And this time we've got three choices...
Tifa,Take your pick.
Barret,Hell is this?
Cloud,M unit. Another type of enhancement.
Barret,Your call if you wanna nix it.
Barret,"I tell you what, I ain't never looked forward to an execution more in my entire life!"
Tifa,You don't say.
Barret,We're about to make fools outta Shinra while the whole damn city's watching! (chuckles) Times like these you gotta savor!
Tifa,"Oh no—if you're about to ask me to dance, then don't."
Barret,"C'mon, don't be shy! How 'bout you, Cloud?"
Cloud,I don't dance.
Barret,"Buncha pushovers. C'mon, y'all. Let's see what kinda mischief they were getting up to."
Cloud,Four consoles. And never enough keycards...
Tifa,Think we've done enough to weaken the robot?
Cloud,"All that we can, at least."
Barret,It's all good. The stage is set—all that's left is to hijack Heidegger's show!
Barret,We're coming up on the exit. Tifa—detonator still in range?
Tifa,We should be good.
Barret,"The moment big boy goes down, you hit that switch."
Tifa,Right.
Barret,Can't say we didn't prepare. Now we just gotta get it done!
Barret,Look! They're still preppin' it!
Barret,Shit! We too late?
Barret,Y'all never had a chance!
Tifa,"Hey, guys."
Tifa,"Looks like a performance assessment, don't you think?"
Tifa,Reduced response time... Should work in our favor.
Cloud,"We'll figure out its weaknesses as we fight it. As long as we stay focused, we'll be fine. We can do this."
Barret,"For real, though, we need to talk victory poses. Something coordinated for the live, on-camera finish! Could blow up big—start a new trend!"
Cloud,Veto.
Barret,Huh. No way up?
Barret,Damn near gave me a heart attack!
Barret,Bastard cleared the way for us.
Cloud,Real subtle invitation.
Barret,We were gonna spring the trap anyway!
Barret,Big boy's going to an execution all right. We're gonna put him out of his misery while the whole damn city watches!
Tifa,We give it our all and we'll win!
Barret,We're gonna get through this. We're gonna make it home. All of us. No exceptions.
Tifa,Right. We don't wanna disappoint Marlene.
Tifa,"That goes for you too, Cloud. Right?"
Barret,You'd better give her a big ol' smile this time.
Cloud,If the price is right.
Barret,What? Open it already!
Cloud,It's locked down.
Tifa,Is there any way we can get it open?
Cloud,Yeah. From that room over there.
Barret,Why does everything have to be so damn complicated...?
Cloud,"You know, the faulty equipment storeroom's that way too."
Tifa,Do you think we'll find the components we diverted there?
Barret,"It's like a treasure vault! Hoo, I like the sound of that!"
Tifa,So how do we do this?
Cloud,"It's simple, really. We move the levers at the same time."
Tifa,Got these ones.
Barret,"I'll take left. Which just leaves right, SOLDIER boy."
Tifa,So we need to synchronize our movements?
Barret,"In that case, follow my lead."
Cloud,Nah—Tifa's.
Barret,Fine! Have it your way!
Tifa,"Okay, pay attention, you two..."
Tifa,"Three, two, one..."
Barret,"I'm, uh, still getting warmed up!"
Barret,Shit!
Tifa,No good. Let's try again.
Tifa,Don't rush it!
Tifa,Um... Breathe when I breathe!
Barret,No need to grip it so hard!
Barret,Got an idea! Seventh seventh heaven heaven hoo-ah! Seventh seventh heaven heaven hoo-ah!
Cloud,Hell no.
Barret,How 'bout this then? Seveeenth heaven! Heaven! Heaven!
Tifa,"We're doing it my way! Three, two, one..."
Barret,"Hey, are you even trying? How 'bout a chant to help us time it right? Aaa-vaaa-lanche!"
Tifa,This is exhausting!
Barret,"Hey, I think I should lead after all. Five...four...three-two-one-go!"
Cloud,Much better.
Tifa,"We got this. Three, two, one..."
Tifa,"Shake it off. Three, two, one..."
Tifa,"Focus! Three, two, one..."
Tifa,"Let's just get through this. Three, two, one..."
Tifa,Thank god...
Barret,"How the hell we made it through with dumbass here, I'll never know."
Cloud,We really are in sync. Took the words right outta my mouth.
Barret,What did you say!?
Tifa,"Okay, that's it. Let's go."
Barret,Gotcha!
Tifa,Now that is what I call teamwork!
Cloud,Go team.
Barret,Hell yeah! (laughs)
Tifa,We really did it! Great timing—right on the money!
Cloud,Yeah...
Barret,"Whatcha'll got tucked away in that vault, huh?"
Barret,This would be the treasure vault?
Cloud,That's right.
Tifa,What's the catch?
Cloud,Need to bypass a high-level security lock.
Barret,Different from the other one?
Cloud,"Same deal, but we gotta do it several times."
Barret,Hah. Not a problem!
Tifa,"Yeah, let's try!"
Tifa,"Okay, guys. You know what we have to do."
Barret,Copy me?
Cloud,"No, Tifa leads."
Barret,"Oh, fine! After you, girl."
Tifa,"Gotta get past level one first, right? Three, two, one..."
Tifa,"That was great, you guys! Let's keep it up!"
Tifa,Wow! Think we've got this?
Barret,"Hell yeah, bring it on! Ain't nothing I love more than sticking it to Shinra!"
Tifa,"Halfway there. Steady, guys. Three, two, one..."
Tifa,No way! You guys are naturals!
Tifa,"Okay, final round. Don't lose focus. Three, two, one..."
Tifa,Finally. I was beginning to think it'd never end.
Barret,"Ayo, Cloud, what's the deal? You really a bona fire SOLDIER?"
Cloud,We didn't train for this stuff.
Barret,All that marching with no rhythm? How did you SOLDIER on?
Tifa,"Okay, that's enough of that. Let's see what's inside."
Barret,"Take that, Shinra? Makin' us jump through hoops to steal your shit..."
Tifa,Didn't take as long as I expected! Good work guys!
Cloud,Likewise. You made it easy.
Tifa,(chuckles) I put my heart and soul into those countdowns...
Barret,Boo-yah! Bet all the Shinra suits watching enjoyed that!
Tifa,You guys were great!
Tifa,"I swear, your timing was perfect. It's almost like...you could read my mind. SOLDIERs can't do that, can they?"
Cloud,I can't—yet.
Tifa,Thank god.
Barret,"C'mon, you two, let's see what we got."
Tifa,Score! It's just like Cloud said!
Barret,They say a job well done's its own reward... I say take everything that ain't nailed down!
Barret,"All right, time to go!"
Tifa,Look!
Barret,President Shinra?
Cloud,Ex-SOLDIER.
Cloud,...That's right.
Barret,Think you forgettin' someone!?
Barret,Ain't enough hours in the day to hold you to account for all your crimes!
Barret,"Oh, okay then... Let's talk about wasteful indulgences. What is mako? The lifestream! The lifeblood of the planet—our planet! But Shinra keeps on slurping it up like a thirsty dog! Whadda you think's gonna happen if you don't stop, huh!?"
Barret,Don't you dare try to put this on us! If anyone's going along with your plans... it's 'cause you brainwashed 'em!
Barret,Wutai? The hell we are?
Barret,What are they doin'!?
Barret,Goddammit!
Tifa,I'm sick of this. I'm sick of all of this!
Barret,"Cloud! Get your head in the game! We're counting on you, man."
Tifa,"Cloud, are you all right?"
Cloud,"I'm fine, You guys good to go?"
Barret,As good as I'll ever be!
Tifa,Cloud? What'd it do to you?
Barret,Dammit! Big boy means business!
Barret,"Damn, that thing's powerful!"
Tifa,That was too close...
Cloud,We need to come up with a plan.
Tifa,I hate when they do that!
Cloud,Let's take care of them first.
Cloud,Now we can finally take it down!
Cloud,"Damn, all those drones. Time to do your thing, big man."
Barret,"Watch and learn! Just make sure you got my back, all right?"
Cloud,Now! Get in there!
Tifa,Yep! I hear you loud and clear!
Barret,Let me show ya how it's done!
Cloud,Yeah. Light 'em up!
Cloud,Now!
Tifa,Right! Give it all you've got!
Cloud,It's coming. Move!
Cloud,"We almost got this. Come on, guys!"
Tifa,Bring it on!
Barret,Let's show 'em what we're made of!
Tifa,Again!?
Cloud,This ends right here!
Barret,We don't have long to get clear!
Cloud,"Take Tifa, and get outta here!"
Barret,I...I was wrong aboutchya—
Cloud,This ain't the end of the line for you or me!
Tifa,Cloud!
Barret,C'mon!
Cloud,Yeah.
Cloud,"""Back then""?"
Cloud,Have we—
Cloud,Why not...
Cloud,"Yeah, yeah..."
Cloud,"Hey, uh... Who are you? Who are you!?"
Sephiroth,I am...your everything.
Sephiroth,"Oh, Cloud. There's still so much to be done."
Cloud,You're...
Aerith,Aerith. It's Aerith. And you are...?
Cloud,Cloud.
Aerith,Nice to meet you again.
Cloud,"""Again,"" huh?"
Aerith,What? You don't remember? What about...the flowers?
Cloud,Ohhh... The flower girl. And this is...?
Aerith,"An old church in the Sector 5 slums. You came crashing through the roof without so much as a ""look out below."" Fell right into my flower bed. Lucky for you. Like, really."
Cloud,"S-sorry, I-I didn't mean to—"
Aerith,Don't worry about it. They're a lot tougher than they look. This place... It has a kind of power.
Aerith,Before I forget—you dropped this when you landed.
Cloud,Thanks.
Aerith,I've got one too.
Cloud,You and everybody and their mother.
Aerith,"Not like mine, no. It's special. Mine's not good for anything at all."
Cloud,Bet you just don't know how to use it.
Aerith,"Could be. Though, I really don't mind. Just having it is enough. It was a gift from my mother."
Aerith,"Pretty crazy, huh? Us meeting again like this. You should stay awhile."
Aerith,"And just when I had finished tending the flowers here... Gotta start over... Just me, myself, and I..."
Cloud,I could stick around a bit.
Aerith,Really!? You will!? In that case...
Aerith,"He's my bodyguard. And a SOLDIER. Pretty cool, huh?"
Cloud,Ex-SOLDIER.
Aerith,"You don't mind, do you? Bodyguard work's not too different from merc stuff, right?"
Aerith,"Uh... I guessed! From the sword! Just do this for me, okay?"
Cloud,"Fine, but it'll cost you. A lot."
Aerith,"A lot, huh? One date ought to do it."
Cloud,First.
Aerith,Hey! Watch the flowers!
Cloud,I'll make this quick.
Aerith,You better!
Aerith,Really? Since when? This is the first I've heard of it.
Aerith,I don't think that counts then.
Aerith,"Cloud, be careful!"
Aerith,Cloud! No!
Cloud,The hell?
Aerith,Weird. They're not attacking.
Cloud,C'mon.
Aerith,Over here!
Aerith,Nowhere to go but up...
Cloud,Huh?
Aerith,Are they trying to stop us?
Cloud,What do they want?
Aerith,Do they want us to go upstairs?
Cloud,Could be a trap.
Aerith,They're...trying to show us the way.
Cloud,I don't like it.
Aerith,"Um, we should run."
Aerith,Through the attic—maybe we can get out that way!
Cloud,Right. Through that hole.
Aerith,Huh? They saved me...
Cloud,C'mon.
Cloud,I'll go first.
Cloud,Come on.
Aerith,"Aw, man..."
Cloud,"Hey, you okay?"
Aerith,Probably! ...Or maybe not.
Cloud,Run!
Cloud,Could drop that.
Cloud,Can't leave now. She needs help.
Cloud,Okay.
Cloud,Run!
Aerith,Kay!
Aerith,Cloud! Over here!
Aerith,Thank you!
Cloud,Let's move.
Aerith,"Cloud, gimme a hand!"
Cloud,More of those things.
Aerith,It's like they're...guiding us.
Cloud,Stay close.
Aerith,So cool.
Aerith,There!
Cloud,Need to stay ahead of 'em.
Cloud,Or not...?
Cloud,They gone?
Aerith,Yeah. Think so.
Cloud,What are they?
Aerith,I think... Actually...I don't know. Let's just go.
Aerith,Okay. Up for crossing the rooftops? See that pillar over there? There's a station right by it. Shall we mosey on over?
Cloud,Let's.
Aerith,So...what's next for you?
Cloud,A little bit of bodyguard work.
Aerith,Right.
Cloud,"After that, it's back to the Sector 7 slums."
Aerith,You...know how to get there?
Cloud,Yup.
Aerith,Course you do...
Cloud,That suit from earlier. He was one of Shinra's Turks. What's a Turk want with you?
Aerith,Dunno...
Aerith,"Hey, don't Turks keep an eye out for potential SOLDIERs and stuff?"
Cloud,They do more than just scout for candidates. Turks get called in to handle all kinds of situations. With extreme prejudice.
Aerith,Professional bad guys. Gotta love 'em.
Cloud,Back to my question. So what's he to you? Looked like you knew each other.
Aerith,Maybe he thought I could be the greatest SOLDIER yet!
Cloud,Forget it.
Aerith,Hmm? You mad?
Aerith,I...actually...haven't traveled by rooftop before.
Cloud,Be surprised if you had.
Aerith,It's honestly...kind of exciting.
Cloud,Well... First time and all.
Aerith,Wait! Give me a moment!
Aerith,Don't just...run off on your own...
Cloud,Those the words of a SOLDIER candidate?
Aerith,So petty.
Cloud,"So, does no one live in these buildings?"
Aerith,Nope. No one to get mad if we make noise.
Aerith,Looks kinda...rusty.
Cloud,I'll go first.
Cloud,It's pretty old. Be careful.
Aerith,Okay...
Cloud,Easy now.
Aerith,You worry too much. I'm not some princess who needs to be coddled.
Aerith,Shit.
Aerith,Cloud!
Aerith,"Whew, that was unexpected! Thank you, Cloud."
Aerith,"Ah, there it is. The wall."
Aerith,"You know, I thought about leaving once... But...in the end, I couldn't."
Cloud,Too dangerous?
Aerith,"Too much. A whole world, bursting with life. Maybe more than I can handle, I think sometimes... Even now. People hate the steel sky, the slums...but I don't. How could I? All that passion, all those dreams... Flowing and blending together into something greater..."
Aerith,"This time I'll go first. After all, I can't count on you to wait."
Cloud,Sure about this?
Aerith,See for yourself!
Aerith,Hmm... Maybe I'll go on ahead and leave you all by your lonesome! Just—
Cloud,Maybe you shouldn't talk.
Aerith,Then you talk. Tell me a story.
Cloud,Not for free.
Aerith,Cheapskate. You're—(screams)
Aerith,Gotcha.
Cloud,You're killing me here.
Aerith,Here goes nothing!
Cloud,You good?
Aerith,Of course!
Aerith,My hero!
Cloud,Never a dull moment with you.
Aerith,That a compliment?
Cloud,Not really.
Aerith,Thanks anyway!
Aerith,"We're getting closer to the station. Even so, we'll probably run into a few monsters on the way."
Aerith,"Heh... There's a face that screams ""so what?"""
Cloud,Eh. I've fought scarier things in my sleep.
Aerith,"Where are you going, Cloud?"
Aerith,"Look out, Cloud!"
Aerith,Someone looks like they're in their element.
Aerith,"So Cloud...you don't know the slums that well, do you?"
Cloud,"Compared to you? No. Training grounds, barracks, battlefields—that's the world I know."
Aerith,"Heh, you sound proud of that."
Aerith,Station's there.
Cloud,I can see that.
Aerith,Oh? Thought the world you knew didn't include stations.
Cloud,Hah hah...
Cloud,Popular place.
Aerith,"Yeah, well, it's got a good view of the reactor."
Cloud,Ain't a show.
Aerith,They know that. They're worried.
Aerith,Huh? Um... Yeah...
Aerith,That's...right.
Aerith,"Not debris, no..."
Aerith,Oh—Cloud! Wait!
Aerith,"Sorry, can't say I do..."
Cloud,Wait.
Cloud,Another Turk.
Aerith,A real man on a mission.
Cloud,"On the hunt, more like."
Aerith,For me? Or you?
Cloud,Don't know. Don't care.
Aerith,Then...let's stick to the backstreets? Ah. There will be monsters.
Cloud,Better than Shinra.
Aerith,There's a Shinra dump site up ahead. Not the kind of place anyone would ever choose to hang around in.
Cloud,But a great place to lay low.
Cloud,They've got the run of it.
Aerith,No telling where they'll come from...
Cloud,Monsters instinctively target weaker prey.
Aerith,"Hmm... You'd better watch out then, Cloud."
Aerith,"That way's a dead end. They were doing some construction, but quit halfway."
Aerith,Over here.
Aerith,That didn't work. Maybe it's broken?
Aerith,"Pretty sure this path we're on loops around, too, so..."
Aerith,"Hmm, wonder if we can move this."
Aerith,"Ah, I knew it!"
Aerith,Must've been a new breed.
Cloud,How do you figure?
Aerith,Cause they went for the stronger prey.
Aerith,There—check it out! The heart of the slums.
Cloud,Still a fair ways off...
Aerith,"Well, we did take a detour. Getting tired?"
Cloud,Nah.
Aerith,"Me, I'm feeling a bit hungry. How about you?"
Cloud,Amazed...
Aerith,You're in for a treat when we make it back.
Cloud,Don't have time for that.
Aerith,You'll wanna make time for my mom's cooking! And that's the final word on it! We'll get home quick and eat ourselves stupid!
Aerith,(screams) It's awake!
Cloud,Gonna wish it kept sleeping.
Aerith,"Don't think it'll open. What to do... That gate just doesn't want to open, does it? Maybe there's a way to get over it? For you, at least."
Aerith,No good. That sucks. Ah! Try moving that container to make a path.
Aerith,Yeah! That should do the trick!
Aerith,"Thanks, Cloud. I knew you'd find a way."
Aerith,Guess we're home free.
Cloud,No need for thanks. I'd rather get paid.
Aerith,Hm? You're getting paid right now.
Cloud,Hm?
Aerith,Huh?
Cloud,Oh...
Aerith,Should be able to relax a little now...
Cloud,Don't forget about the Turks.
Aerith,Ah!
Cloud,Could come at us anytime. Keep an eye out.
Aerith,Uhhh... That's the station.
Aerith,Somewhere else you'd rather be?
Aerith,What're they watching?
Cloud,Hey!
Aerith,Alright...let's go.
Aerith," Hey, my house is this way."
Aerith,"The place is really hopping, huh?"
Aerith,"I'd love to, but..."
Aerith,I help out every now and then. It's fun.
Aerith,"Well, well, what are you doing all the way up there?"
Aerith,This is Cloud. He's a mercenary...and currently my bodyguard. That's Oates.
Aerith,Two peas in a pod.
Aerith,"So, what are you guys up to?"
Aerith,What for?
Aerith,"Well, guess we have a new destination."
Aerith,I should probably explain. The Leaf House is the local orphanage. That's where all these kids live.
Aerith,Apparently. But they sure keep me on my toes!
Aerith,No problem. Anytime.
Aerith,"(chuckles) Oh, I have my ways."
Aerith,He's my bodyguard. Just until I get home.
Aerith,Hmmm... Maybe?
Aerith,"Since I'm so generous, I gather medicinal herbs for his patients sometimes."
Aerith,Here's the Leaf House.
Aerith,Don't be. It's on my way home.
Aerith,No problem! How many?
Aerith,"I'm sure they will, and I'd love to help."
Aerith,"So, Cloud, what's your favorite flower?"
Cloud,They're all the same to me.
Aerith,(chuckles) You sure you wanna say that to a florist?
Cloud,Better than lying.
Aerith,"Okay, then what'd you do with the flower I gave you?"
Cloud,"I, uh..."
Aerith,You give it away?
Cloud,I did.
Aerith,Ooh! To who? Tell me!
Cloud,Don't recall.
Aerith,Hmmm?
Cloud,What?
Aerith,Thought you didn't like lying.
Aerith,"Well, anyway..."
Aerith,"My house is just up this path. Mom should be home by now, so I'll introduce you."
Aerith,There you go. That's my house.
Cloud,It's amazing.
Aerith,Come on.
Aerith,I'm home!
Aerith,"So, this is my mom, Elmyra. And this is Cloud. My bodyguard."
Cloud,Uh...hi.
Cloud,That's my job. Or was my job.
Aerith,"Yep. Thanks. So, Cloud, you gonna head back to Sector 7?"
Cloud,Yeah.
Aerith,Then I'll show you the way.
Cloud,Then why'd you have me bring you here? What if the Turks show up again?
Aerith,"It'd suck, but I've dealt with them before. Honestly, I'm much more worried about you. What if you get lost, huh? You'd be too embarrassed to admit it, so you'd just and so you'd just keep on going."
Cloud,Quit acting like you know me.
Aerith,"Hey, Mom? I'm gonna go take Cloud over to Sector 7, okay?"
Aerith,"That's true. She's got a point, Cloud."
Cloud,Hold up.
Aerith,"Oh, yeah! I still need to deliver some flowers to the Leaf House. Since we have a little time before dinner... You should come with."
Cloud,That wasn't the deal.
Aerith,You mean you want more? Even though you've got a priceless reward coming your way? Do you know what I promised him?
Cloud,I'll do it!
Aerith,I'll go grab the baskets. Be right back!
Aerith,That's weird. Could've sworn I put them here...
Cloud,Huh.
Aerith,Found 'em!
Aerith,You take this one. Take it.
Aerith,Right. Off we go!
Aerith,"And these, right here, are my babies."
Aerith,Hmm... Which ones do you think we should pick?
Cloud,Any of them.
Aerith,"Aw, don't be like that. I know you have an eye for this kind of thing."
Aerith,That's the one I gave you.
Cloud,Huh. It is?
Aerith,"Nice try, mister. You can't fool me."
Aerith,"Whoa, foxtails, huh? I gotta hand it to you, I never would've thought of that. It'll definitely take them by surprise."
Aerith,"Good eye. People used to give these to declare their loyalty to one another. Interesting, right?"
Aerith,I think we still need a few more. What should we pick next?
Aerith,"She said ""as many as you can carry,"" so maybe a few more?"
Aerith,I think we're good now. Whaddya say? Shall we go?
Aerith,No need to hurry. We're not under the gun or anything.
Cloud,I'm not cut out for this crap.
Aerith,"Sure you are. And when you're done, you'll be drowning in job offers."
Aerith,"So, how do you think they'll arrange these flowers?"
Cloud,Dunno.
Aerith,"Well, we'll soon find out."
Cloud,I'll wait out here.
Aerith,"Oh, okay. But I might be a while. Why not check out the town?"
Cloud,"Nah, can't leave without telling her."
Cloud,I remember you...
Cloud,The Leaf House.
Cloud,Is something wrong?
Aerith,You could say that. Sounds like someone spooked the kids.
Cloud,A Turk?
Aerith,"That's what I thought, but no."
Aerith,I don't like the sound of this. I'm gonna check it out.
Cloud,I know someone who fits that description. I'll come with.
Aerith,Kay.
Aerith,"Ooh, that sounds fun. Count me in."
Aerith,And that's bad?
Aerith,"I know this place is off-limits to grown-ups, but if we want to rescue them...well... We gotta break the rules."
Aerith,"Yeah, leave it to us. We'll take care of it from here."
Aerith,Don't worry. I've brought a superstrong friend along with me.
Cloud,I used to be a SOLDIER. So where's the guy?
Aerith,"Right now, let's worry about the kids."
Aerith,Where do you think they went?
Cloud,Who knows. They're kids. Nothing to do but look all over.
Aerith,I just hope we find them in time.
Aerith,There they are!
Cloud,And they're not alone.
Aerith,Quickly! We gotta save them!
Cloud,Alright.
Aerith,Hold on!
Cloud,Careful.
Cloud,I'll go.
Cloud,C'mon.
Aerith,Okay. Let's head back.
Aerith,"Well you see, Cloud here used to be a SOLDIER!"
Cloud,I might've.
Aerith,"Look at you, Mr. Popular."
Cloud,Tifa...
Aerith,Tifa?
Aerith,What's wrong?
Cloud,Nothing.
Aerith,"Is Tifa, like...your girlfriend?"
Cloud,No.
Aerith,But she's someone special.
Cloud,It's not like that. More like... I don't know how to explain...
Aerith,I see...
Aerith,"From now on, if you run into trouble, promise me you'll find an adult, okay?"
Aerith,Don't worry. It'll be okay.
Cloud,Wait.
Cloud,"Hm. Not him, but looks pretty damn similar."
Aerith,"Huh? There's the number...but why ""2""?"
Cloud,Who knows. Come to think—
Sephiroth,The reunion...is nothing to fear.
Aerith,Cloud? Get it together. Come on.
Cloud,You don't know who Sephiroth is...do you?
Aerith,"Sephiroth, the war hero? I know he died in an accident five years ago. They said so on the news."
Cloud,Maybe they did. But I've got a feeling he's still alive.
Aerith,"Oh...right. C'mon, let's go."
Aerith,"Well, I'm all for it! We still have plenty of time."
Cloud,I'm on the clock.
Aerith,Don't worry. I give you permission!
Aerith,"I see you're working hard, mister merc."
Cloud,Yep.
Aerith,So whaddya gonna do next?
Cloud,Keep on working hard.
Aerith,"As you always do, I'm sure."
Cloud,"You know, this is how I earn a living."
Aerith,Huh? Really!? I thought you were just doing it for fun!
Cloud,I suppose some people do.
Aerith,Hello! I'm some people. Nice to meet you!
Aerith,"It feels good to help people out, doesn't it?"
Cloud,Eh.
Aerith,You having fun yet?
Cloud,Heaps.
Aerith,"Then you can't be afraid to show it more. Don't forget, it's all about service and salesmanship."
Cloud,I'll leave that to you.
Aerith,"All right, but don't think you can rely on me forever, mister."
Cloud,Wasn't planning to.
Aerith,That's good. 'Cause I demand a very good salary.
Aerith,We probably oughta call it a day.
Cloud,"Getting late, huh?"
Aerith,"You've been working so hard, you lost track of time."
Cloud,Had to. The pay sucked.
Aerith,Cause they didn't know if you were worth it yet. But now they do. C'mon. Let's go home.
Aerith,Great job. It's wonderful.
Aerith,What do you want?
Aerith,"He's my bodyguard, if you must know."
Cloud,And what if I am?
Aerith,"Cloud, leave him be. Rude's not a bad person. Really."
Cloud,You Turks are all the same. All bark...no bite.
Aerith,No need to get rough!
Aerith,Can't you leave us alone?
Cloud,Come on then.
Cloud,First Class.
Aerith,"So, you had enough yet?"
Aerith,Just stop it.
Aerith,"Cloud's pretty strong, isn't he?"
Cloud,How's that payback working out for ya?
Aerith,No...but this is self-defense!
Aerith,Please. Just leave us alone.
Aerith,Got somewhere else to be?
Aerith,You know I can't do that!
Aerith,You're heading in already?
Cloud,Yeah. That's enough for one day.
Cloud,Nah. Not quite yet.
Aerith,Oh my! Is that a moogle!?
Aerith,"You must not be familiar with ""Mog the Moogle."" It's a pretty famous fairy tale. Mog wanted to bring happiness to all the moogles of the forest, so he decided to open a shop of wonders."
Cloud,Uh...you talking 'bout me?
Aerith,"So, Moggie, what do you do with the medals we give you?"
Aerith,Of course. Just like Mog the Moogle.
Cloud,Good for you.
Aerith,"Hey, Cloud...maybe say it like you mean it?"
Cloud,Not until I'm happy. Go on. Work your magic. Make me smile. From ear to ear.
Aerith,"Well, that won't do! C'mon Cloud—let's go get more!"
Aerith,"Former SOLDIER turned problem solver. Are you okay, Ms. Folia? You look upset."
Aerith,Patrols? Is that a Leaf House thing? Something they do to help out?
Aerith,Would you like us to go round them up?
Cloud,"Who knows, but isn't there something else you should be worrying about right now?"
Aerith,Hey there. How goes the patrol?
Aerith,"Well, you've been keeping a very sharp lookout. But don't you think you're forgetting something important?"
Aerith,Hey there. How goes the patrol?
Aerith,You've been busy.
Aerith,Hey there. How goes the patrol?
Aerith,You wanna open up a shop of your own someday?
Aerith,You sound very determined.
Aerith,I guess that means more children might be coming to the House soon.
Cloud,"Speaking of teachers, Ms. Folia is looking for you."
Aerith,That's everyone. Let's go back to the House.
Aerith,"The toad ""king""?"
Cloud,"Oh, yeah. Real easy. But here's the thing...I don't work for free—or cheap."
Cloud,I'll do it for three gil. I'm offering a special discount right now on toad king jobs. Looks like it's your lucky day.
Cloud,Yup. Kicked his butt real good.
Aerith,"Wow, Ms. Folia. You must know all their secrets."
Cloud,Sounds exhausting.
Aerith,I know you are.
Aerith,Do you have somewhere you need to be?
Aerith,I wonder what kind of dream she's chasing tonight.
Cloud,No idea.
Cloud,I'll handle it.
Cloud,Maybe.
Cloud,Now hold on—
Aerith,"Anyway, I think it's safe to say our work here is finished! If you're ever in the market for a merc again, remember you can count on Cloud!"
Cloud,Yup.
Aerith,"Ugh, that rag? The one that's always printing awful rumors about the slums?"
Aerith,"Everyone knows her. Everything she steals, she gives to the poor and needy."
Aerith,"Good to see you again, Mireille."
Aerith,"Cloud, meet Mireille. She knows everything there is to know about the slums. Mireille, meet Cloud. He's a former SOLDIER, and super strong."
Cloud,I am?
Cloud,Not looking into it for the reporter. I'm doing it for myself. Call it curiosity...or whatever.
Aerith,Have you tried talking to Mireille at all? She told us that she had some information to share.
Cloud,Okay then. Guess we should look around.
Cloud,"""The Guardian Angel of the Slums will collect your offering on behalf of the poor."""
Aerith,This must be one of her calling cards!
Cloud,I don't see anything else interesting. Let's head back and tell them what we found.
Cloud,So much for my reward.
Cloud,It'll cost you.
Aerith,Didn't we buy a graveyard key off Moggie? I think we did.
Aerith,This must be it.
Cloud,No thanks. I think you've got it covered.
Aerith,We paid our respects to your wife—and we took care of those creatures.
Cloud,This is the graveyard key. Run it back to Moggie.
Cloud,Okay. It'll cost you five thousand gil though.
Aerith,Wait a sec.
Aerith,So...you coming?
Cloud,You talking to the...
Aerith,Shh. So yeah... It was that kind of day.
Aerith,Let's go. Shouldn't keep Mom waiting.
Cloud,Hey... What'd they say?
Aerith,"""Good work today, guys."""
Aerith,Kidding. They didn't say a word. But you know... Ah...never mind. It's not like you'd believe me after all.
Cloud,...Probably not.
Cloud,Tell me anyway.
Aerith,Really?
Cloud,Yeah.
Aerith,"It won't be much longer now. The flowers, they...they have something important to tell us. Something they...need to share with us. At least, that's the feeling I get. But...before they can...there's a final step that has to be taken. Otherwise...we won't hear them. Maybe I should just give up. Honestly, it's what I do best."
Cloud,"Could've fooled me. From what I've seen, you're no quitter."
Aerith,Well today's special! That's why I've been working my butt off.
Cloud,Uh...What's so special about it?
Aerith,"(laughs) Okay, time to go!"
Cloud,Learn to talk to her.
Aerith,Did the flowers say anything?
Cloud,"Uh... ""Good work today, guys""?"
Aerith,(chuckles) That's the spirit!
Aerith,Sorry. We got a little sidetracked.
Aerith,"Ah, great!"
Aerith,"Gotcha! Take a load off, okay?"
Cloud,Ex-SOLDIER.
Aerith,I'm back!
Aerith,Starving. Right?
Cloud,Not really.
Cloud,I can take care of myself.
Cloud,Don't want to overstay my welcome.
Aerith,What're you doing?
Cloud,...Nothing.
Aerith,Did you have a bad dream? Don't worry. You'll feel much better in the morning. And I promise to take you straight home.
Cloud,Uh... Okay.
Cloud,Please don't let her hear me again.
Aerith,You jerk! I thought I told you not to leave your room. Now get back in there!
Cloud,Okay...
Aerith,No. More. Games.
Cloud,"So, how do I get to Sector 7?"
Cloud,Was one.
Cloud,You got it.
Cloud,Sure.
Aerith,"Well, look who it is. Talk about a coincidence."
Cloud,What're you doing here?
Aerith,Waiting.
Cloud,Why?
Aerith,Because I'm not sick of you yet.
Cloud,"Lead on, then."
Aerith,With pleasure. (hums)
Aerith,Cloud? Is something wrong?
Cloud,It's nothing.
Cloud,You can see the sky.
Aerith,"They're still working on the new plate. I don't like this part of Midgar. Back when they were still building Midgar, there was an accident, and the plate fell. People had only just started moving in, so there weren't a lot living there at the time, but..."
Cloud,And that's...?
Aerith,"The underside of Sector 6. ""Wall Market."" A real special place. But...I'm sure you already knew that, right?"
Cloud,"I didn't tell you? I enlisted pretty much right after I left home. Dunno much about this place, or any of the slums."
Aerith,"Well, it took a lot of people to build Midgar. And they all needed to blow off steam. So some traders built an entertainment district. Inns, shops, bars, the works. Folks started pouring in from all over. Business was booming, money was flowing... Which attracted the attention of some guys who...didn't much care for the law."
Cloud,And now there isn't any.
Aerith,"Right. But instead of trying to solve the problem, the government decided to just wall it in. And that's how Wall Market began. ""Out of sight, out of mind,"" as the old saying goes. For the folks in charge, there's no better way to deal with it."
Cloud,So it's like a giant veil.
Aerith,Yeah. Wanna see what's behind it?
Cloud,Not really.
Aerith,"That's good—'cause I know a better way to get to Sector 7. One that—tragically—doesn't go through Wall Market. And it's just through this tunnel here. At least it was, back when I was a kid."
Aerith,"It's been like this, you know. Ever since the plate fell."
Cloud,And there's no other way?
Aerith,It'll be an adventure.
Cloud,What's that?
Aerith,"A big arm. Kinda cute, don't you think?"
Aerith,"Oh, great. Someone's pulled up the ladder."
Aerith,I wonder if we can use this.
Aerith,"Here's an idea. I'll hop on, and you give me a ride."
Cloud,You serious?
Aerith,Absolutely! I'll throw down the ladder for you to climb up after.
Aerith,Piece of cake! Gimme a sec.
Aerith,And here comes the ladder.
Aerith,Well? What did I tell ya?
Aerith,You did it!
Cloud,Yeah...
Aerith,Hm?
Aerith,"Alright, good enough. Let's keep on truckin'!"
Cloud,Stop.
Aerith,Did we wake it up?
Aerith,"Huh, that's weird. Used to be a way through here."
Aerith,I wonder if someone blocked it off because of all the monsters that kept showing up.
Cloud,Pretty dangerous place for kids to play.
Aerith,"Raised in the slums, remember?"
Cloud,You're tough.
Aerith,"Hmm, that supposed to be a compliment?"
Aerith,Looks like a dead end.
Aerith,"Hey, I bet you can grab that container with the arm."
Aerith,"Not half bad! So, do you moonlight as a crane operator or something?"
Aerith,Yeah?
Aerith,Uhhh...
Aerith,"Aw, no. Look. Why's it always gotta be so tough? Lucky for me, you'll make this easier."
Cloud,"Yes, ma'am."
Aerith,"Well then, I'm gonna head down."
Aerith,"Okay, Cloud! Ready!"
Aerith,Hold on a second.
Aerith,Gotcha!
Aerith,"Okay, right there! Hold on while I drop the ladder!"
Aerith,"Cloud, over here!"
Aerith,"Whoa. Not too fast, okay?"
Cloud,Got it.
Aerith,"Well, jumping's not an option, that's for sure."
Cloud,Look.
Aerith,Someone made a campfire.
Cloud,"If they found a way down, so can we."
Aerith,Anybody around?
Aerith,Guess it's just us.
Cloud,It's still warm.
Aerith,Should we relight it? Have our own campfire?
Cloud,I need to get back. Besides—
Cloud,We haven't done anything wrong.
Aerith,Yeah. We were just passing through.
Aerith,"Okay, what do you want?"
Aerith,I think we've heard enough.
Aerith,"Random question, but...why did you quit being a SOLDIER?"
Cloud,That is random.
Aerith,You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.
Aerith,"Um, did you have any SOLDIER friends? Any war buddies?"
Cloud,No...not really.
Aerith,"Oh, okay."
Aerith,"Stupid ladders. Always out of reach... Okay Cloud, heading down. You're in charge of the arm, got it?"
Aerith,Gotcha.
Aerith,Cloud?!
Aerith,That went pretty well.
Cloud,Sure did.
Aerith,"Hm? Wait a minute, did you just...?"
Cloud,Nope.
Aerith,"Don't worry, we'll be on the same page next time."
Cloud,What are you talking about?
Aerith,"I'm sorry, okay!"
Aerith,We made it! Smell the fresh air?
Aerith,Cloud. Up top.
Aerith,"Alright, there it is. The gate to Sector 7."
Cloud,Looks shut. How do we open it?
Aerith,"More importantly, how about we take a break? Sound good?"
Cloud,No. I don't have time for—
Aerith,Up there looks nice.
Aerith,C'mon!
Aerith,"You know, a long time ago, I used to sell flowers here."
Cloud,Oh yeah?
Aerith,"So, Cloud... You were a SOLDIER First Class, right?"
Cloud,Yeah.
Aerith,Weird.
Cloud,Really? What's weird about it?
Aerith,Nothing. Just that you were the same rank.
Cloud,As who?
Aerith,The first guy I ever loved.
Cloud,What's his name? I probably know him.
Aerith,Are you okay?
Aerith,Wow... Your eyes.
Aerith,"Yeah... I know. Sorry, I'm bumming you out. We should go."
Aerith,"Gotta look forward, not back."
Aerith,Here. This won't take long.
Aerith,Ready! Wanna get to Sector 7 in style? This is the passageway for you.
Aerith,(chuckles) Go ahead.
Cloud,You gonna be okay getting home?
Aerith,And if I said I wasn't?
Cloud,I'll go with you.
Aerith,Thought you needed to get back? (chuckles) Don't worry. I have a backup route for emergencies. And it's safer too.
Aerith,"Guess this is it, then. Ready?"
Cloud,Yeah.
Cloud,No.
Aerith,"Aww, you big softie. Gonna miss me?"
Aerith,Shall we?
Cloud,Yeah.
Cloud,No...
Aerith,Nothing wrong with taking a little break.
Cloud,Tifa!?
Tifa,Cloud! You're alive! I thought we'd lost you!
Cloud,What's going on?
Tifa,"Shh. I'll explain everything later. But now, I'm on my way to see Don Corneo. You should head back to Seventh Heaven, meet up with the gang."
Cloud,But—
Tifa,I'll be fine. You've seen how much ass I can kick.
Cloud,I have...
Aerith,Oh no you don't. You're going after her.
Cloud,She's a big girl. She can handle the likes of him. And worse.
Aerith,Uh-uh. You don't know Corneo. It doesn't matter how strong or smart you think you are. He'll find a way to turn it against you. And where's she going to meet him? A mansion filled with his goons. Come on. Aren't you worried what might happen in there? You have to help her!
Aerith,Come on!
Cloud,Kay.
Aerith,"Come on, Cloud. We gotta hurry!"
Aerith,You gave a ride to a girl earlier. Do you have any idea where she went?
Cloud,"Can't say I can, no."
Aerith,We're looking for a girl who took one of your carriages. Can you help us find her?
Cloud,Guess. We want to save—
Aerith,Save her from a life without this handsome guy!
Cloud,Well...
Cloud,She's in great shape.
Aerith,Is that really important?
Cloud,Um...she's a great fighter.
Aerith,I'm not sure that helps.
Cloud,She's...great at handling the books.
Aerith,"Cloud, I really don't think that'll help."
Cloud,That's her.
Cloud,What do you mean?
Aerith,An audition for what?
Cloud,So where can we find this Don Corneo?
Aerith,And there goes our best lead yet. Maybe we'll have better luck in town. Let's check it out.
Aerith,"No, thank you! Come on, Cloud—let's go!"
Cloud,...No thanks.
Aerith,"But you thought about it, didn't you?"
Cloud,How much?
Aerith,Cloud!
Cloud,Back off.
Aerith,Sorry. We're in a rush.
Aerith,Maybe it's broken?
Cloud,Aren't you that Leaf House—
Cloud,What are you doing here?
Aerith,Check it out! I think we might've found our man...and he's a gaudy one.
Cloud,Yeah...
Cloud,We're looking for someone.
Cloud,"Yeah, so?"
Aerith,"How 'bout me, then? Can I go inside?"
Aerith,Excuse you?
Aerith,"Come on, can't you help us out?"
Cloud,Aerith.
Aerith,Cloud...requesting permission to kill.
Cloud,Denied.
Aerith,And who can give us that?
Aerith,"Hmm, duly noted. Thanks for the info. We'll be back soon."
Cloud,Seen Tifa around?
Aerith,Who was that...?
Cloud,Nobody you want or need to know.
Cloud,Aerith. You sure about this?
Aerith,If you've got any better ideas...
Cloud,Not really.
Aerith,Huh?
Aerith,"Not the sharpest tool in the shed, is he?"
Cloud,Nope.
Aerith,"Wait, hear us out. You're one of the Trio, right? I want you to get me into the audition."
Aerith,Pretty please?
Aerith,Really!?
Aerith,Next time will be too late. Can't you get me into this one?
Aerith,How can you be so sure Corneo will pick Tifa? You never know. He might pick me.
Aerith,Sure do!
Cloud,Heads.
Cloud,Tails.
Cloud,No thanks.
Aerith,I am! Heads!
Cloud,Wait. Mind if I see that coin of yours?
Cloud,Trick coin. I had a hunch.
Aerith,That's cheating!
Cloud,And that's the Wall Market way. Lesson learned.
Aerith,Still cheating.
Cloud,This the place?
Aerith,Think so.
Cloud,"Lemme handle this. You wait out here, okay?"
Aerith,"And why would I do that? No, I'm coming with."
Cloud,I'm not really sure that—
Aerith,"You're a man of many talents, but ""talking"" isn't one of them."
Aerith,Whoa... (chuckles)
Aerith,Heya.
Cloud,We're here to see Andrea Rhodea.
Cloud,"Oh, we don't have an appointment."
Aerith,Three years!?
Cloud,All we want is five minutes. He can spare that.
Aerith,I need his help for the Corneo audition.
Aerith,Is there really no other way?
Aerith,"I guess that's that, then. Ah well. Let's try someone else."
Aerith,I guess they're closed right now?
Aerith,Say what?
Cloud,We're not customers.
Aerith,Hoping you can help us get an invite to an audition with Don C—
Cloud,...Cloud Strife.
Cloud,Huh?
Aerith,Cloud...
Cloud,No...
Cloud,Right.
Cloud,Little rough.
Cloud,Actually... Yeah...
Cloud,Wait!
Cloud,Everything...hurts...
Aerith,How was it?
Cloud,Huh?
Aerith,You okay?
Cloud,Yeah...
Aerith,"You're acting weird, Cloud."
Cloud,I am?
Aerith,Really weird.
Cloud,"S'alright, I guess."
Aerith,What are you doing?
Cloud,Flexing.
Aerith,Flex-ing...?
Cloud,Uh... Never mind.
Cloud,Not now. Maybe not ever.
Aerith,Did something happen to you in there?
Cloud,Just...just give me a sec.
Aerith,Just one?
Cloud,Maybe a few minutes.
Aerith,So...
Aerith,"You're one of the Trio, right? I want to get into Corneo's next audition."
Aerith,Really!?
Aerith,Huh?
Aerith,Is something wrong with my outfit?
Cloud,"It's alright, I guess."
Aerith,"(chuckles) Oh, you."
Cloud,"It's comfortable, isn't it?"
Aerith,"Cloud, the fashion critic."
Cloud,It matter what I think?
Aerith,Well I think it's pretty cool.
Aerith,"Sorry, we'll stop. So...what should I do about the outfit?"
Cloud,How much?
Cloud,There any prize money?
Cloud,All right.
Aerith,What have we gotten ourselves into?
Cloud,Nothing good. I wouldn't expect a fair fight in this town...
Aerith,Think we can win it all?
Cloud,That's one thing I'm definitely sure of.
Aerith,"I appreciate the confidence, just...don't get too cocky, okay?"
Cloud,"Team? No, it's just me—"
Aerith,Yes! The two of us are a team!
Aerith,"I need to get into that audition, but I won't let anyone else fight my battles for me. That includes you, mister."
Aerith,"Down, down, down we go."
Aerith,"So how deep does this thing go, you think?"
Aerith,I wonder how many people are fighting.
Aerith,"Hey, you're not nervous, are you?"
Cloud,Nope.
Aerith,Really? You're even more quiet than usual.
Cloud,Just trying to focus. Like you should.
Aerith,"Wow, this place is really something."
Aerith,Ouch! What happened to your face?
Aerith,We're in way too deep to back out now.
Aerith,How is it?
Cloud,It's thick...
Aerith,"But you...like it so much you couldn't possibly share, right?"
Aerith,Okay. Now I'm mad.
Aerith,You brought animals?
Aerith,Well that's one win down. Go team!
Aerith,What's wrong?
Cloud,The rules don't make sense.
Aerith,"Yeah, true. But maybe it'll be better in the next match?"
Cloud,"Nah, wouldn't bet on it. Better to expect the worst."
Aerith,"Hey, it's those guys."
Aerith,Huh? More of 'em?
Aerith,Hey! That's cheating!
Aerith,This is ridiculous!
Aerith,Next up the big finale.
Cloud,Yeah.
Aerith,I thought you'd be happier.
Cloud,Just thinking about what we might face next.
Aerith,"But you know, we've made it this far. I'm sure we can handle anything they throw at us."
Aerith,Robots!?
Cloud,More like Shinra armor.
Aerith,More like cheating!
Aerith,"Now that that's over, we can go save Tifa."
Cloud,"So we'll head back to Madam M's, get you changed, and then it's off to Corneo's."
Aerith,Right!
Aerith,What do you mean?
Cloud,Meaning what?
Aerith,Hey! That wasn't the deal!
Cloud,So this is the last one?
Aerith,Huh?
Aerith,It's just...a house.
Cloud,That's no ordinary house!
Cloud,Wait!
Aerith,What the—
Cloud,Look out!
Aerith,We did it!
Cloud,Hey. No one asked you to do that.
Cloud,Not interested.
Aerith,Oh boy! I can't wait to see the dress!
Aerith,"Ouch! Well, I'll see you later, Cloud!"
Cloud,"...Yeah, why not."
Cloud,The Sauce?
Cloud,Where?
Cloud,"I don't need to ""whip it out."" I've done this before. Watch this."
Cloud,It's just sauce. No big deal.
Cloud,I know.
Cloud,Hey. About that thing we're looking for...
Cloud,I should help Johnny first.
Cloud,Well...
Cloud,Besides this dumbass?
Cloud,I've got meds. Lemme take a look at you.
Cloud,Should probably head back.
Cloud,Better already?
Cloud,I did about as much as I could.
Cloud,I'm done with this. You—you can do whatever the hell you want.
Cloud,Couldn't agree more. Should probably go see Sam again.
Cloud,Nothing I haven't seen before. That it for jobs?
Cloud,What's your angle?
Cloud,Not here for the cash. Tell me about Tifa.
Cloud,Hey.
Cloud,Cut to the chase. Well? You helping or not?
Cloud,You're coming with me.
Cloud,So what about the donations? Do you need help taking them to the Leaf House?
Cloud,"""The Guardian Angel of the Slums, radiant defender of the downtrodden""...? Huh. Wonder if I'm an accomplice."
Cloud,That's enough of that. Should head on back to Madam M.
Cloud,"Wait, you're here? What about Aerith?"
Cloud,...That right?
Cloud,Just doing what I've always done.
Cloud,Take a deep breath. What about Tifa?
Cloud,Well I do.
Cloud,Nope.
Cloud,I said—
Cloud,No.
Cloud,Go find Aerith at Madam M's. Tell her to wait for me there once she's done. Think you can handle that?
Cloud,Yeah. It's for Aerith.
Cloud,I wasn't asking for permission.
Aerith,Heya...
Cloud,"Uh, Aerith? What are you wearing?"
Aerith,"I know right? It's bad. Like, super bad. I've been trying to figure out if there was anything more I could've done with it, but..."
Cloud,Doesn't really matter if you get picked or not anyway.
Aerith,"Yeah, but still... You put a lot of work into this."
Aerith,...Did you put a lot of work into this?
Aerith,Heya.
Cloud,Hey. What are you wearing?
Aerith,I hear Corneo likes his girls super-duper girly and dolled up. But I thought he might appreciate something a little more down to earth for a change.
Aerith,"What, you don't like it?"
Cloud,I...didn't say that.
Aerith,Then...does that mean you do like it?
Cloud,Uh...
Aerith,Heya.
Cloud,That's really...
Aerith,Yeah. Corneo's got certain...tastes. This dress is so gaudy and impossible to move in...
Cloud,Y-yeah...
Aerith,Cloud!?
Cloud,Scuse me.
Cloud,"Hey, wait a minute. Did Johnny forget to give you my message?"
Aerith,"The one asking me to stay put? No, I got it. I was worried about you."
Cloud,"I'm starting to think this place is more dangerous than we thought. Who knows what they'll ask you to do in this ""audition."" No way in hell I'll let you go in there by yourself."
Aerith,"By myself? Oh, don't worry, I wasn't gonna. Come on. You'll see."
Cloud,"See what, exactly?"
Aerith,"According to Madam M, you've caught the eye of a certain fabulous someone, and they'd like to meet in person."
Cloud,Huh?
Cloud,Why are we here?
Aerith,"To see the Honeybee Inn's Andrea Rhodea, and convince him to give you his stamp of approval. You said you didn't want me going alone, right? Well, with Andrea's help, you can join me. It'll be fun! And honestly, I think you'll look pretty cute in a dress."
Cloud,What!?
Aerith,"It's pretty rare for Andrea to take a personal interest in someone. At least, that's what Madam M said. Trust me, this is gonna work out great."
Cloud,Uhh...
Aerith,C'mon. Don't you wanna save Tifa?
Cloud,Wait—
Aerith,"No can do, Cloud. This is our plan, and you'll learn to love it. So! Here's how I think we should approach him. Madam M said Andrea was a man who'd give anyone a fair chance to win him over. So I say we march right up to him, explain the situation, and see where that gets us. Sound good?"
Aerith,C'mon. Don't you wanna save Tifa?
Cloud,We're here to see Andrea Rhodea.
Cloud,"""Mr. Cloud""?"
Cloud,What stage?
Cloud,"No, I'm not here for—"
Cloud,Why would I want do that?
Cloud,Hey! Hold on!
Aerith,Woohoo!
Aerith,Woohoo! You're a start!
Aerith,"(laughs) Keep it up, Cloud! Work it!"
Aerith,C'mon Cloud! Get into it!
Aerith,"Uh, umm..."
Aerith,Nice moves! (laughs) I love it!
Aerith,"Well, you tried...?"
Cloud,Please don't.
Cloud,Not a word.
Aerith,Not even one?
Cloud,No!
Aerith,But you're so pretty!
Aerith,Hey! Watch the way you walk.
Aerith,No time to dillydally-let's go!
Aerith,"Here you are—letters from Andrea Rhodea and Madam M. That ought to do the trick, right?"
Aerith,Is there a problem?
Aerith,"Oh, we'll be fine."
Aerith,"What's that weird, sweet smell? And why do I feel so dizzy?"
Cloud,Gas. Come on.
Cloud,Dammit.
Aerith,Cloud...
Aerith,Where...are you...taking us?
Tifa,"Hey, can you hear me?"
Cloud,Tifa!?
Tifa,Yes...?
Cloud,You okay?
Tifa,...Mm-hmm.
Cloud,Good.
Tifa,"Wait a minute. (gasps) Cloud!? Is that you!? Oh my god, that makeup! And that dress!"
Cloud,"Nailed it, I know. Thank you. Moving on."
Cloud,You good?
Aerith,"Yeah. Bit woozy, but I'll manage."
Aerith,"Hey, Tifa. How you doing?"
Tifa,Okay...
Aerith,Oh right—I'm Aerith. A friend of Cloud's. We were worried and thought we'd come help you out?
Tifa,Thanks...?
Cloud,Cut the chatter. We gotta leave.
Tifa,Huh?
Cloud,Right now.
Tifa,No! Not until I've got what I came for.
Cloud,What?
Tifa,"So... After we made it back to the slums, some guys came around asking all kinds of questions. So I did some digging..."
Cloud,And found out they were Corneo's men.
Tifa,Right. They were interested in Avalanche... But...I couldn't figure out why. So I thought I'd come and ask the man himself.
Cloud,Seriously?
Tifa,"Thought if I could find a way in, and get some one-on-one time... But then I realized I'd only be one of three candidates. And that if he didn't pick me...it would all be for nothing."
Aerith,"Then your worries are over, aren't they? Because the other two candidates are right here. Right?"
Cloud,Right...
Aerith,"So yeah! If we're all in on it, then nothing can go wrong!"
Tifa,"Uh, I guess not..."
Aerith,"You—me—Cloud. Makes no difference who gets chosen, does it?"
Tifa,"I dunno, Aerith. It feels wrong getting you involved in all this."
Cloud,Don't even bother trying to talk her out of it.
Aerith,Aww! Cloud gets me! Took you long enough.
Cloud,So what happens now?
Tifa,I think they'll call for us when it's time.
Aerith,This room gives me the creeps.
Cloud,All right guys. Let's do this.
Tifa,(chuckles) Do you want to do this?
Aerith,"""Today's""?"
Cloud,Pathetic.
Cloud,Back off.
Cloud,What was that?
Cloud,Asshole...
Aerith,"Yeah...I guess I'm good to go whenever. How 'bout you, Tifa?"
Tifa,Mmm...Four guys between us... Okay. Let's not keep Cloud waiting.
Aerith,Right.
Tifa,Get down!
Tifa,"Good job, Aerith!"
Aerith,It was nothing compared to you!
Aerith,Thank you!
Aerith,"Okay, let's go rescue Cloud."
Tifa,"Corneo's room, right?"
Cloud,You depraved bastard!
Tifa,"Sorry, but... Your boys had to learn some manners too."
Aerith,Cloud! Your clothes!
Tifa, We'll ask the questions. Like why'd you have men in Sector 7 asking about Avalanche?
Tifa,Don't play dumb with me. Let's try again. Why did you have men in Sector 7 asking about Avalanche? Spill the beans or...
Cloud,I'll cut 'em off.
Tifa,Paid by who?
Tifa,Well you better...'cause if you don't...
Aerith,I'll rip 'em off.
Tifa,Shinra!? And what were they planning?
Aerith,"See, I'm not so sure they are. Better keep talking..."
Tifa,Or I'll smash 'em.
Tifa,The pillar?
Tifa,They wouldn't...
Aerith,"Come on, guys! We gotta go!"
Cloud,No.
Cloud,"When they're faced with certain death, jackass."
Cloud,When they think they've already won...right?
Cloud,I dunno. When they've lost their minds?
Cloud,Where in the...?
Cloud,"Damn, it reeks."
Cloud,Tifa?
Tifa,Cloud... We have to get to the slums—right now!
Cloud,Yeah.
Tifa,I didn't wanna drag Aerith into all this...
Cloud,She'll understand.
Tifa,How do you two know each other?
Cloud,"I saved her, she saved me... Round and round it goes."
Tifa,And...that's all there is to it? Sure there isn't something else going on?
Aerith,Dammit.
Cloud,Aerith.
Aerith,Cloud... We have to get to Sector 7...
Cloud,Yeah.
Tifa,That bastard!
Tifa,You gotta be kidding me!
Cloud,Good to go?
Aerith,You bet!
Tifa,Bring it on!
Tifa,There it goes...
Aerith,"Do you think it lives down here, or...?"
Cloud,Was probably Corneo's pet. And we were dinner.
Aerith,(mimics Corneo's laugh)
Tifa,"Hey... You don't believe that crazy story of his, do you? Shinra wouldn't sacrifice a whole sector just to take out Avalanche, would they? Destroying part of the city—killing all those people, just to get at us?"
Cloud,I dunno... Is Corneo the kind of guy who'd make up shit just to screw with you?
Tifa,I wouldn't put it past him.
Aerith,"But...if he was telling the truth... And there's still a chance he was, isn't there? Then...we should go. And if it turns out he was lying, then so what? Right?"
Cloud,Tifa!
Tifa,I knew it. These tunnels are all connected.
Cloud,What is it?
Tifa,"I'm pretty sure we can use these tunnels to make our way back to Sector 7. The sewers under Sectors 6 and 7 should be connected. ""If you get in trouble, just follow the stench."""
Cloud,Another one of those lessons?
Tifa,"An Avalanche saying, actually. We use them to move around the undercity. In emergencies."
Cloud,Sure we're not lost?
Tifa,Positive. There should be a big waterway just up ahead. Let's find that first.
Aerith,"Ugh, it reeks down here."
Tifa,"Well the undercity isn't exactly the prettiest place, and we're under that so..."
Tifa,Is it safe to go through here?
Aerith,It's really dark.
Tifa,I'm sure we'll be fine. Come on.
Tifa,"Hey, Cloud... Assuming Corneo was telling us the truth... What do you think Shinra's really up to? I mean, they've gotta have an endgame, but I can't imagine what it is. Destroying a whole chunk of the city just to get back at us doesn't make any kind of sense."
Cloud,Yeah. I can't imagine any way they could profit from it. It's gonna cost them a fortune to rebuild.
Tifa,Corneo's lying. He's gotta be. Guys like him do it all the time out of habit.
Cloud,Locked up tight.
Tifa,But not if we used the skeleton key Jessie made.
Aerith,Huh. Does this mean it's in the water?
Cloud,We'll see.
Cloud,"That's a power generator, all right."
Aerith,Wow. Talk about ancient.
Cloud,It's an antique—older than the mako reactors even. It'll be a miracle if it still works.
Cloud,This it?
Aerith,It worked!
Tifa,Wait a minute. I know this place. Sector 7 should be just on the other side of this waterway.
Cloud,So this is where Sector 6 ends.
Tifa,And where Sector 7 begins. Once we cross over we can start looking for a way back to the surface.
Cloud,Might be harder than you think.
Tifa,Let's just try to make our way down this tunnel. See if we can't use those gates to clear a path. We can do this. We'll figure it out.
Aerith,"Yeah, for sure."
Tifa,All right! Now we should be able to get across.
Cloud,"I'll go first, okay?"
Tifa,Dammit. I can't stop thinking about what Corneo said.
Aerith,I know... Me too.
Tifa,It's gotta be a trick. There's no way they'd go that far. But... But what if Corneo really was telling the truth...? We have to get there in time to stop it. We have to.
Aerith,Right.
Tifa,"Aerith, what are you not telling me?"
Aerith,Huh?
Cloud,Guys! C'mon! We gotta keep moving!
Tifa,Coming! I'll go first.
Tifa,Okay Aerith! Your turn!
Aerith,On my way! Here we...go.
Tifa,Almost there!
Tifa,Aerith!
Cloud,Jump!
Tifa,That was close.
Aerith,Thanks. You saved me.
Tifa,(chuckles) Least I could do.
Aerith,"Hear that, Cloud?"
Aerith,C'mon.
Tifa,Focus!
Aerith,Still thinking about the plate?
Tifa,Yeah.
Aerith,The future isn't...set in stone. That's what I always tell myself.
Tifa,Yeah...? I hope you're right.
Aerith,"How 'bout this, then? Think of something fun. After saving Sector 7, you're gonna...?"
Tifa,"I'm gonna... Go shopping—topside! I'll buy... Stuff for the bar! Decorations, coasters..."
Aerith,Can I come?
Tifa,You'd better!
Aerith,Then it's a date! (both laugh)
Tifa,Cloud can carry all our stuff!
Aerith,He'll be our pack chocobo!
Cloud,What was that about me?
Tifa,Nothing! (chuckles)
Tifa,Huh!? No way!
Aerith,"C'mon, Tifa!"
Aerith,Cloud! Hold on tight!
Tifa,"On three, okay? One, two, three!"
Cloud,Sorry 'bout that.
Aerith,No need to be.
Aerith,Look. That must be the way out!
Tifa,I wonder. There must be some way we can lower the water level.
Tifa,"Guys, check it out. Seventh Heaven's water tank has something similar. I'm betting we can use this to control the sewage level."
Aerith,Hey Cloud—you wanna give it a try?
Cloud,This oughta drain the water...right?
Aerith,No luck?
Cloud,Must be busted.
Tifa,"A red light indicates a blockage, apparently. We can use the hand pump to clear the blockage. Sounds about right. I remember having to do this at the bar before."
Cloud,Alright. I'll—
Tifa,"Aerith, you mind giving me a hand? Cloud, you stay put. Keep an eye out for more red lights."
Cloud,"Wait, I'm not sure—"
Tifa,Trust me. This is the best way to handle it. We'll be back soon.
Tifa,So maybe this is a little different from the one at the bar. More...industrial?
Aerith,Here goes.
Tifa,Spectacular!
Aerith,That went well.
Tifa,Try to stay in sync.
Tifa,Keep calm.
Aerith,Coulda gone better...
Tifa,"Alright, I think that did it!"
Aerith,Wonderful!
Tifa,"Okay, let's head back. Cloud's probably getting worried."
Cloud,Nicely done.
Tifa,We make a great team.
Aerith,Go team!
Aerith,Sure is nice to go up for a change.
Tifa,Hope the pillar's not much further...
Cloud,Hang back. I'll go on ahead and secure the exit.
Tifa,Cloud!
Tifa,Looks like they're hungry for more.
Aerith,We're not delicious! Not even a little bit!
Cloud,Get going.
Tifa,Now!
Aerith,Okay!
Cloud,You too!
Tifa,But there's too many of them!
Cloud,Not for me.
Tifa,Hurry!
Cloud,"Last warning! Back off, or die!"
Tifa,Cloud!
Aerith,C'mon!
Cloud,Just on patrol.
Aerith,Don't worry. We'll make it in time.
Cloud,We could get lost in here.
Tifa,This is the train graveyard all right—a real treasure trove of scrap. Sector 7 should be just past that large maintenance facility over there. I vote we stay past the light so we can see where we're going.
Aerith,"Dark, dark, everywhere..."
Cloud,That it?
Aerith,It's deserted...and kinda creepy.
Tifa,"People don't come around here often. And not just because of the monsters, but...because of the stories."
Aerith,What kind?
Tifa,"Everyone seems to think that the train graveyard...is haunted. ""Those who lose their way out there in the dark of night will never, ever find their way back home again."""
Cloud,Is that right?
Tifa,"I mean, it's not like I think it's true or anything, but you know...it's just..."
Cloud,Then let's hurry.
Tifa,"Guys, what was that!?"
Tifa,(screams) Don't scare me like that!
Tifa,I think I just heard a little kid... Did you guys hear it too?
Cloud,Why would there be kids out here this late?
Tifa,What? Then—
Tifa,Huh? What is that!?
Cloud,You okay?
Aerith,All good...I think.
Tifa,Still in one piece here too.
Tifa,Guys?
Cloud,Seriously?
Aerith,"""Come on,"" huh? Well, that's...inviting."
Cloud,"Alright, let's see what's inside."
Tifa,"Well, whaddya think...?"
Aerith,Hmm... I'm game!
Tifa,But...
Aerith,"It'll be fine! We've got a bodyguard, don't forget. Mine! Right?"
Cloud,Ghosts aren't my thing.
Tifa,You're just being modest! After you!
Cloud,"Mind letting me go, then?"
Tifa,What was that!?
Aerith,Look! Over there!
Aerith,Found you. Hey...can we talk? Just for a bit?
Cloud,Get back.
Aerith,It's you...
Aerith,Don't!
Cloud,That thing's dangerous.
Aerith,"I know, but even so..."
Tifa,What the—!?
Cloud,Run!
Cloud,You okay?
Tifa,Yeah.
Aerith,"Thanks, Cloud. You saved us."
Cloud,Gonna need to find another way through.
Tifa,Wh-what now?
Aerith,"That's not funny, you know."
Cloud,Guess the crane's up there.
Cloud,It's not working. There's no power coming through.
Aerith,I wonder if this is another prank? Someone might be messing with the power supply to make us run around.
Tifa,Do you think there's...more in here?
Aerith,Looks like.
Aerith,Aha! Found you!
Tifa,I'm pretty sure I saw a door on the other side of this place. I think our only choice might be to find another route.
Aerith,Tifa!
Aerith,"""Coming to get you""...?"
Cloud,I don't have time for your shit.
Aerith,"""That was fun""... All this time, you were waiting for someone to come and play with you."
Cloud,What're you talking about?
Cloud,"C'mon, let's get back to the crane."
Tifa,"""Those who lose their way out there in the dark of night will never, ever find their way back home again."" What do you guys think would've happened if they'd caught us?"
Aerith,I wonder... Maybe they're the ones who were caught.
Cloud,Can we just drop the whole—
Aerith,What if they're trapped here and can't leave?
Tifa,Just like we hoped! What a relief.
Aerith,We should be able to get through now.
Cloud,Let's find out.
Aerith,We're through!
Tifa,Great. Let's head outside.
Tifa,Wait.
Aerith,A girl?
Tifa,Marlene?
Tifa,"Marlene, what are you—"
Tifa,We can't waste any more time here.
Cloud,What was that about?
Tifa,Nothing you need to worry about. Let's get going.
Aerith,It's moving!
Tifa,Maybe now we can get to the other side.
Tifa,"This path is blocked too? But we're so close, I can see it."
Aerith,"Hey, do you think these trains might still run?"
Cloud,Could give it a try.
Cloud,Good call. Looks like it still works.
Aerith,I knew it!
Tifa,Everybody good?
Cloud,Yeah.
Aerith,Huh? I think that's...
Cloud,Tifa...
Tifa,They're really gonna drop the plate.
Cloud,They won't if Barret and the others have anything to say about it.
Aerith,All we can do now is keep moving.
Tifa,Please... Please let us be in time.
Cloud,Why am I not surprised?
Aerith,Wow—would you look at that!
Tifa,Thanks.
Cloud,Let's go.
Tifa,Almost there. Come on!
Cloud,Right.
Aerith,Cloud!
Cloud,Aerith!
Aerith,"You're just trying to help, aren't you?"
Aerith,You. You're the one who...
Cloud,Aerith!
Tifa,Hey. We found you.
Aerith,I guess you did.
Cloud,Let's go.
Tifa,How do we hurt it?
Aerith,Hit it with magic.
Cloud,It'll bounce right off. Gotta deal with the barrier first.
Aerith,Cloud!
Tifa,Look out!
Tifa,"Hold on, guys. We're coming."
Tifa,And you...can go to hell!
Tifa,Let's go.
Cloud,Right.
Aerith,Right!
Tifa,It's that ghost...
Tifa,Wow...
Aerith,So long.
Tifa,We made it!
Barret,"Got your lethal force right here, asshole!"
Tifa,Dropping a whole plate...just like that. No. No way.
Aerith,Tifa!
Aerith,Please! Let us through!
Cloud,What are you!?
Aerith,"Cloud, Tifa! We have to get past, whatever it takes!"
Tifa,Right!
Tifa,There's too many!
Cloud,Aerith?
Aerith,Come on!
Barret,What you got!? Come on!
Tifa,That's Barret!
Cloud,You okay!?
Cloud,I know.
Cloud,Stop! Stay with Wedge. I'm going up.
Aerith,Sure.
Tifa,"Wedge, please. Let Cloud handle it."
Aerith,Don't worry. I'll patch him up.
Cloud,Wedge—listen to me. You stay here with them.
Cloud,Biggs!
Cloud,Don't worry. He'll bounce back.
Cloud,Don't talk.
Cloud,I won't.
Cloud,What about you?
Cloud,"That, you'll have to do yourself."
Cloud,No.
Cloud,This isn't over.
Cloud,Not good.
Tifa,Get down!
Aerith,Thank you!
Aerith,How is it?
Tifa,I'm sorry. I can't stay here—I have to help them.
Aerith,Go. Follow your heart.
Tifa,Aerith. There's a bar in the center of town—Seventh Heaven. I need you to—
Aerith,Get Marlene to safety. Right? It's okay. I'll find her.
Tifa,Huh?
Tifa,"Can you take her to the bar for me, Wedge?"
Aerith,"Wedge, wait!"
Aerith,Wedge!
Aerith,"That's not true, Wedge. Don't give up hope yet! We can still save a lot of lives!"
Aerith,Mm.
Aerith,"Yeah... I do. But...that's no excuse to give up. I don't wanna look back one day...and wish I'd done it different. Right here, right now, I need to know I did everything I could."
Aerith,"Wedge! Seventh Heaven is just down this road, isn't it?"
Aerith,Don't worry about me!
Aerith,"Get out of Sector 7, please! You need to get as far away from Sector 7 as possible! Right now! Go to Sector 5 or 6—anywhere but here!"
Aerith,You all have to get out of Sector 7! Now! Please!
Aerith,"Well, there's still time, but..."
Aerith,Yes.
Aerith,Just a friend.
Aerith,I've got to get to Seventh Heaven!
Aerith,That's it!
Aerith,Oh no...
Aerith,Marlene!
Aerith,Ow... Marlene...
Aerith,"Oh, no! Need to find another way to get there!"
Aerith,Gotta get through. Gotta find a way.
Aerith,Finally!
Aerith,Hold on.
Aerith,"Oh, you poor thing!"
Aerith,"I know it must hurt...but you've got to be brave now, okay?"
Aerith,I'll take you to her. Ready?
Aerith,"Almost there, okay?"
Aerith,No need to rush. Steady now...
Aerith,I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.
Aerith,Can you take care of her?
Aerith,You'll be fine.
Aerith,"Please, I need to get through!"
Aerith,Almost there!
Aerith,Please be okay.
Aerith,"Hold on, Marlene. I'm coming for you."
Aerith,"You're Marlene, right?"
Aerith,I'm...a friend! Of Tifa's!
Aerith,"Right now, she's with Cloud and the others."
Aerith,You mean Barret? Yep. He's there too.
Aerith,"Not yet. That's why I came to find you. Tifa asked me to. She said, ""Take care of Marlene."" The thing is, this place isn't safe now. I'm gonna take you somewhere safer, okay?"
Aerith,"I know it's hard. Just remember, you still have your daddy. You can build a new home together. Anywhere. Shall we go?"
Aerith,Oh?
Aerith,I hope you remember it. C'mon.
Aerith,Tell you what. We'll grow lots of flowers at your new house.
Aerith,Of course you can. Hey—what's your favorite flower?
Aerith,Tseng.
Aerith,There's nothing to be scared of. Okay?
Aerith,How about...we make a deal?
Cloud,Gotta move.
Tifa,Cloud!
Cloud,What the hell!?
Tifa,Nice catch!
Cloud,You're crazy!
Tifa,"Just like you. So suck it up, 'cause I'm not leaving."
Cloud,Where's Aerith?
Tifa,I sent her to Seventh Heaven to get Marlene out.
Cloud,And Wedge?
Tifa,I asked him to show her the way.
Cloud,Okay.
Tifa,We can still stop this...right?
Cloud,Yeah.
Tifa,Then let's keep moving!
Tifa,What was that?
Tifa,Jessie!
Cloud,Like hell they're your last.
Cloud,Just try to hang on!
Cloud,Yeah. You owe me a pizza.
Tifa,Jessie...
Cloud,Hey...
Barret,(screams) I ain't done with you yet! You hear me!? Think you can come up in here—do what you want—and we're gonna take it!?
Tifa,Barret!
Barret,Tifa!? Get your ass behind cover! Now! Chopper's gonna chew you up!
Cloud,Still alive and kicking?
Barret,Damn right! Leadin' man sticks around till the credits roll! Though we gotta keep moving if we wanna make it that far. You ready?
Cloud,Yup.
Cloud,You!
Barret,"You're next, asshole!"
Cloud,Press it.
Cloud,Careful. He's quick.
Barret,"Yeah, quick at runnin' away, maybe!"
Cloud,Had to.
Cloud,"Heads up, guys!"
Barret,"Confident, ain't we?"
Cloud,How do we stop it?
Barret,Where you going!?
Cloud,Move!
Barret,Getting real tired of your shit!
Cloud,Tifa!
Barret,Where'dja—
Barret,You son of a bitch! What have you done!?
Tifa,Cloud!
Cloud,Tifa!
Tifa,What do we do!?
Tifa,You can't do this!
Tifa,Aerith!
Barret,Marlene? My Marlene!? What did you do with her!?
Cloud,Where are you!?
Cloud,"""Ancient""?"
Cloud,Aerith!
Tifa,"No, no, no..."
Barret,"If we don't get the hell outta here right now, we're dead! We gotta think of something! Think dammit think! Look around... Gotta be something! Shit...shit... Shit!"
Barret,Hey! Over here! Found us a way out!
Cloud,Tifa.
Barret,"C'mon, c'mon!"
Barret,Now!
Barret,Hey! Anybody out there!?
Tifa,Barret!?
Tifa,I think I hear him up ahead!
Barret,Hey! Can anybody hear me!?
Cloud,Here goes.
Tifa,And push!
Barret,Marlene... Marlene! Marlene!
Barret,Marlene! Biggs! Wedge! Jessie!
Barret,Goddammit. Goddamn you! Goddamn you all! (cries)
Barret,Marlene... Marlene... (cries)
Tifa,It was us. We did this.
Barret,"No. You can't think like that. Whatever came before, it was Shinra that pulled the trigger today. Am I right!?"
Tifa,...Yeah.
Barret,Hold on to this. This...anger. Okay?
Cloud,Barret. Marlene's fine. Aerith found her.
Barret,Aerith? Is that the girl they took?
Tifa,Yeah. That's her.
Barret,The hell's going on!?
Tifa,I asked Aerith to find Marlene and take her somewhere safe.
Barret,And she did? You sure!?
Barret,Hey! Where you going!?
Barret,I said—where you going?
Cloud,Aerith's house. It's in the Sector 5 slums.
Barret,And that's where Marlene is?
Cloud,Where we hope she is.
Barret,"Tell me she is! Give me something to hang on to! Even if she's not. I won't blame you for it, I swear!"
Barret,Who am I kidding. I'd probably try to tear your head off.
Cloud,"Hey, Tifa. Know anything about ""Ancients""?"
Tifa,I know I've heard of them at least.
Barret,"They come up in planetology books. Meant to be the original stewards of the planet. Could even ""commune"" with it. Talk to it and stuff."
Cloud,That must be why the Turks wanted her so badly.
Tifa,Cloud?
Cloud,It's nothing. Let's go.
Cloud,You doing all right?
Cloud,Wait. Over there.
Barret,What the hell are they doing here?
Cloud,"Their jobs, probably. Just focus on seeing Marlene again. Nothing else."
Cloud,Thanks to you I did.
Cloud,How bad is it here?
Barret,You guys run into Jessie at the pillar?
Tifa,Yeah...Biggs too. They were both in pretty bad shape. But Wedge wasn't up there with 'em. He got out.
Barret,All right.
Barret,"I've been thinking, y'all... We gotta go find the others."
Tifa,Huh?
Barret,"If we don't look for them, who will?"
Tifa,...Right.
Barret,"Hey, Cloud. Gonna need your help with it too."
Cloud,Right.
Barret,"This is Sector 5, right? So where's this place you said Marlene is?"
Cloud,Where I think she is. It's a house on the other side of town.
Barret,"Well, come on then, pick up the pace!"
Cloud,I'm going as fast as you are.
Cloud,That's the house.
Barret,Marlene! Marlene!
Barret,Where's Marlene!? Is she here!?
Cloud,Barret!
Barret,"Sorry. I'm Barret. Marlene's my little girl. Marlene—she's got short hair. She's cute as a button, with the heart of an angel. She was wearing... Uh...pink! She was wearing a pink dress today!"
Tifa,I wanna see her too. C'mon. Let's go look in on her.
Barret,Marlene...my baby. Thank god.
Tifa,Sh.
Cloud,I'm sorry.
Tifa,"No. I'm the one who asked her to go get Marlene. We'd only just met, but she was so kind and helpful. I...took advantage of her."
Cloud,Because she's an Ancient. That it?
Barret,"Their planet, huh? Yeah, that sounds about right."
Cloud,"They knew where she was, but they didn't just take her? Doesn't sound like the Turks I know."
Cloud,I doubt it.
Tifa,Cloud. Maybe she's right about this. Maybe they'll let Aerith go when it's all over. Maybe...we'd be better off waiting a little while.
Barret,Let's head back to Sector 7. Got things to take care of. Like...checking up on the bar.
Tifa,Yeah.
Cloud,Okay.
Barret,We're gonna win this fight. I promise.
Tifa,The main entrance to Sector 7 is buried under rubble now. So how are we supposed to get back inside?
Cloud,Underground passage in the park.
Barret,"Ah, good plan."
Tifa,But how do we get to the park?
Cloud,I know another way to get there. Aerith showed me before.
Barret,Heh. This Ancient girl knows her stuff. Didn't mean anythin' by it.
Barret,"Aight, let's keep moving."
Barret,Friends of yours!
Tifa,Over there!
Barret,Huh? That a way out?
Tifa,I'm almost afraid to go back. To see it with my own eyes...
Cloud,Tifa...
Tifa,Come on.
Barret,Wymer! You're alive!
Barret,Who else made it out?
Tifa,It's fine.
Barret,I'm just glad you survived. Gives me hope for the others.
Barret,Yeah... Left a few things behind.
Barret,Okay. Let's see what's on the other side.
Barret,Again!?
Cloud,That one was a lot closer.
Barret,My god...
Barret,Make room!
Tifa,Marle!
Cloud,With me. Ready and—
Barret,"Great job, guys."
Barret,Don't know. Find something—anything—to do.
Barret,No.
Barret,Okay. First the bar...then the rest.
Barret,"Hello! Anybody out there!? If you can hear me, say something!"
Cloud,Tifa.
Cloud,Get back!
Barret,Shit!
Tifa,Hear that?
Cloud,That's Wedge's cat.
Barret,What?
Tifa,Let's follow it.
Barret,"Ready? One, two, three!"
Tifa,Is this all that's left of Wedge's place?
Barret,Hey! We're coming down! Stay right where you are!
Barret,Hmph. This place reeks of Shinra.
Tifa,Wedge?
Barret,Wedge!
Barret,Of all the times! (screams)
Barret,Tifa! Cloud! Shout if you can hear me! Hey!
Barret,"If there's no path, you gotta make one."
Barret,Must be a secret Shinra facility.
Barret,How long it take 'em to build all this beneath our feet?
Barret,Man...you'd think they dug halfway to hell.
Barret,"Just no escapin' them, is there?"
Barret,I'm really gonna enjoy burning it all down.
Barret,"Tifa! Hey, Tifa!"
Tifa,Barret!
Barret,You okay?
Tifa,"To tell you the truth, not really. I think there's a nest around here somewhere. Can you take care of it?"
Barret,I gotcha!
Barret,Sorry.
Tifa,I don't know.
Barret,"Well, he can take care of himself. We've got bigger issues."
Barret,Are you all right?
Tifa,"Yeah, I'm good, thanks."
Barret,All right. Gotta go find Wedge. Come on.
Tifa,"I'm afraid to ask, but did you just shoot your way in here?"
Barret,"Well, yeah. Worked, didn't it?"
Barret,If I gotta climb another damn ladder...
Tifa,Hey. You think Wedge is holding up okay?
Barret,"Of course he is. He's a lot tougher than people think. Probably sleeping soundly, dreaming about his cats."
Tifa,You're right. We should treat him to a nice meal when he gets back. His choice.
Barret,Gotta stay on my toes if I'm gonna make it outta here alive.
Barret,Wedge!
Tifa,He's okay.
Barret,You sure?
Barret,(chuckles) Making me worry like that. I'd kick your ass if you didn't look like shit! Thank god.
Tifa,Thank you!
Tifa,Okay. Let's go.
Barret,Uh—sure!
Barret,Yup...it's you all right.
Tifa,What is this...?
Tifa,Barret!
Barret,The hell is this now!?
Barret,Where were you freaks hiding!?
Tifa,Are they Shinra experiments!?
Barret,"Hah! Well if that's the case, then it's only right we put the bastards down!"
Barret,"Ah, of course there's more."
Tifa,You good?
Barret,Like you even gotta ask!
Barret,Gettin' real tired of this shit!
Tifa,This is ridiculous.
Barret,"We gotta close that duct. Tifa, you're up!"
Tifa,Okay! Cover me!
Barret,Tifa!
Tifa,Seriously!?
Tifa,It's using its friends as weapons!?
Barret,"Hey, Tifa! Heads up!"
Barret,Huh! Getting tired?
Tifa,Look!
Barret,"(laughs) Well, that sure looks like a weak point to me!"
Barret,All that's left is to deal with these freaks!
Tifa,Cloud!
Barret,"Bout time, merc."
Cloud,You're up.
Barret,Late to the party and you're giving me orders?
Barret,Hell yeah!
Barret,So how'd you manage to track us down?
Cloud,Followed the trail of bullet holes. There's nobody else I know who'd leave that kinda mess.
Tifa,"Oh, god...were those..."
Barret,People?
Cloud,Yeah. That's the Shinra I know.
Tifa,Cloud?
Barret,What the hell was that?
Tifa,We need to get him somewhere safe. Everything else can wait until after.
Barret,Agreed. Let's go.
Tifa,Cloud.
Cloud,Good kitty.
Barret,"I want you to take Wedge back for me. I'm gonna look around for the others. He made it, didn't he? They could still be alive."
Cloud,"I saw them both at the pillar... Jessie and Biggs. Saw...how bad they were hurt. I'm sorry, but..."
Barret,Don't.
Tifa,They've returned to the planet.
Barret,They...they were supposed to return to us.
Barret,But if we stop now...they'll never let us live it down. So...we carry that weight.
Barret,I'm sorry. I truly am. We had no other place to go and...
Cloud,"Elmyra. I know what you said, but you have to let us go after Aerith."
Cloud,"We found an underground Shinra lab where they've done human testing. This wasn't the first time and it won't be the last. I know these people, and I know they're never gonna let Aerith go. She's the last living Ancient on the planet. Think about what that means to Shinra's scientists. Especially to that son of a bitch Hojo. We're all just numbers and meat to him."
Cloud,But—
Barret,You should rest up while you can.
Cloud,Likewise.
Barret,"Nah, I'm good—real good. 'Sides, when I close my eyes, I start thinking 'bout things. 'Bout people. Like Finn. Lazy little punk. Kid would do damn near anything 'cept what you told him. But ask him to paint you a picture and boy howdy. Those Stamps in the tunnels? Finn's work. Every one."
Barret,"Then there's Al. Intel guy. He had these tricks for stealing codes I still don't understand. Stole his share of hearts, too. But, when it came to the ladies, he just had the one trick. Bouquet of flowers hidden behind his back. Funny to think, some of 'em might've even come from here. He pulled the flower trick on Tifa once, believe it or not. She told him where to stick 'em."
Cloud,Course she did.
Barret,"Our quartermaster, Nellie, had a good laugh at that. She was tight with Jessie. People sometimes took 'em for sisters even. They'd say ""No way!"" and get upset, but then they'd start giggling and you knew..."
Barret,"Yeah... They'll all be fine. They're strong. They're tough. Like me. After we save Aerith, I'll introduce you to them."
Cloud,Sounds good.
Barret,Never thought I'd feel better after talking with your hard-boiled ass.
Cloud,Think you can sleep now?
Barret,Oh yeah. Like a baby.
Cloud,Can't sleep?
Tifa,No. You too?
Cloud,I heard footsteps.
Tifa,Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you.
Cloud,I'm a light sleeper. It's a SOLDIER thing.
Tifa,"That flower you gave me the other night. That was from Aerith, wasn't it?"
Tifa,"I knew there was something weird going on. You, buying flowers. They symbolize reunion, believe it or not. I was curious, so I looked it up. I tried to keep it alive as long as I could. But now...it's dead and buried."
Tifa,Like the bar...our home...and everything else.
Tifa,They took everything from us. Again. (cries)
Tifa,"Cloud... Cloud, you're hurting me."
Tifa,It's stupid. I know that crying's a waste of time.
Cloud,That's not true.
Tifa,Thank you.
Cloud,How is this...? Is this a dream?
Aerith,Maybe. You tell me.
Cloud,You okay?
Aerith,"Don't I look it? I used to live in the Shinra Building, back when I was really little."
Cloud,Your mom told us.
Aerith,"Right. So it kinda feels like I've gone back to my childhood home, you know? Honestly, it's not that bad."
Cloud,"So what, you wanna stay?"
Aerith,"C'mon, Cloud. Don't be silly."
Cloud,Your mom's really worried too.
Aerith,"""Too""? So you're worried about me?"
Cloud,Of course I am.
Aerith,I'm sorry about that. Really.
Cloud,Is that...?
Aerith,Everyone dies eventually.
Cloud,I suppose.
Aerith,"So we need to make the most of the time we have—to live our lives the way we wanna live. Every minute...every moment, matters."
Cloud,I'll remember that.
Aerith,Good. So...
Cloud,You need to embrace this moment. Right?
Aerith,"I'm glad I met you, Cloud. I really am. I'm grateful for all the words we've shared. For all the moments and the memories. You've made me more happy than you know. And I'll always cherish what you've given me. But... But whatever happens, you can't fall in love with me. Even if you think you have...it's not real."
Cloud,Do I get a say in all this?
Aerith,It's almost morning. Time to go.
Cloud,I'm coming for you.
Aerith,If that's what you want. Thank you.
Barret,"You've done more for us than we deserve. I won't forget this. If you ever need anything, all you gotta do is holler."
Cloud,Elmyra.
Cloud,She's calling out to me. I can feel it.
Tifa,We all can. So please. She's our friend. We have to help her.
Barret,Mm.
Barret,Marlene...
Barret,"I'm sorry, honey. I wish I didn't have to. I wish I could be with you all the time. I really do. But if I stay here, I can't fight out there."
Barret,"Some bad people are...trying to hurt the planet. And Daddy...Daddy and his friends are trying to stop those bad people. The slums, your friends, the whole planet—it's Daddy's job to protect it."
Barret,"And that's why I've gotta go. You remember that nice girl who came to find you? Well, now we have to go find her. And when we bring her home, you ned to say thank you, okay?"
Barret,What?
Barret,We will.
Barret,"Of course, I promise."
Tifa,Barret...
Barret,She's tougher than me.
Barret,Aight! Time to get some payback.
Cloud,Don't forget why we're doing this.
Barret,"I know, I know. To rescue Aerith."
Tifa,"So, how're we supposed to get topside? With everything that's happened, the trains still aren't running."
Barret,"Well, we could walk along the tracks."
Cloud,The city's on high alert. All the roads and public transit have probably been locked down by now.
Barret,So what's the plan then? You know another way up?
Tifa,"No, but I think I know someone who might."
Cloud,You mean Corneo.
Barret,"We ain't no damn pawns of Wutai! I couldn't care less about the rest, but that shit?"
Tifa,No one will listen to us. There's no point in even trying.
Tifa,I'm sorry.
Barret,"Hey... Hey Tifa, listen. There's no room in this for regrets or what-ifs or any of that. All we can do is keep moving forward. Keep following this path we chose. Wherever, so we can say we did all we could."
Tifa,"I know. But...right now...instead of looking forward, you need to look around. Everyone here is terrified. So I'm asking you...don't."
Tifa,"I know we're short on time, but let's try to help out wherever we can."
Tifa,Do we really have to deal with Corneo again?
Cloud,Got no other choice.
Barret,What? Did you guys get into it with him or something?
Tifa,I don't wanna talk about it.
Barret,"Huh? Hey, Cloud, what ha—"
Cloud,Don't recall.
Barret,No one's home.
Tifa,"Well, we need to find a way to get topside as quickly as possible, and we figured Corneo oughta know one."
Barret,You serious? Then tell us!
Cloud,Let's just hear him out.
Barret,So...what's the deal with the hole?
Tifa,You want us to go back into the sewers with you? What's down there?
Barret,"You're not gonna try to screw us over, are you?"
Cloud,All right. We're in.
Barret,Say what?
Cloud,"He betrays us, he dies."
Tifa,He means it.
Barret,Seriously—what's the deal with the hole?
Cloud,It's a trop for the don's enemies.
Barret,What?
Cloud,Don't worry. I'll know.
Barret,Just stay calm and wait here. Never know—they might come back on their own. Okay?
Barret,Hmm. Gotta be one of them lost kids.
Barret,What'd you say?
Cloud,What're you doing out here? And where's everyone else?
Cloud,Heads up!
Barret,So why'd you kids come out all this way?
Barret,...I do.
Barret,Buncha little smart-asses... With good hearts.
Barret,Worried about 'em huh? All right. I think we can help you out.
Barret,Okay then! That makes three.
Cloud,We'd better check in at Sam's.
Cloud,We're looking for a way topside. Know one?
Barret,What? Got a problem?
Barret,Ain't these fools got anything better to do?
Barret,Oh yeah...? Wait!
Tifa,This is bad. Really bad.
Barret,Let's move!
Barret,Heard you punks were lookin' for me. Didn't wanna keep you waitin'.
Cloud,But am I?
Cloud,"That's right. You'll tell everyone we were never here—that the rumors were bullshit. And if we hear about you, or any of your friends, coming round here ever again..."
Tifa,You'll answer to my boot.
Cloud,I was hoping you knew a way we could get topside.
Tifa,Me?
Cloud,Tifa?
Tifa,I can't believe I won.
Tifa,"No, thank you for...the same!"
Tifa,Betty. I'm so glad to see you're okay.
Barret,Don't worry. She's safe.
Tifa,That's a wonderful idea.
Barret,"Okay! If we find any music discs, we'll bring 'em straight to you. You just promise to crank up the volume, all right?"
Barret,"Hell yeah, that's it! That's the fire we need right now! Be a force for change, brother!"
Tifa,Our pleasure. I think we needed it too.
Barret,"(hums victory fanfare, laughs) Until our victory fanfare rings out through all of Midgar, our battle will rage on! Hey, I'm just kidding."
Cloud,So what do you need?
Cloud,I told you to stop calling me that.
Cloud,"Fine, what?"
Cloud,(sighs) What'd she look like?
Cloud,Kyrie...?
Barret,Which way'd she go?
Cloud,You Kyrie?
Tifa,(chuckles) Someone mugged our friend and took every last gil he had. Sound familiar?
Barret,Now I remember you. You're that chick. The one who was spreadin' lies in Sector 5.
Cloud,"Stole from them too, did you?"
Barret,Wait a minute—that was you!?
Tifa,"Kyrie, please. Just give us the money you stole from our friend, would you? And the key while you're at it."
Cloud,We'll handle Shinra if you give us the key. Deal?
Tifa,You're joking!
Barret,It's a miracle you've managed to stay alive this long.
Barret,Guessin' he's the guy she's runnin' from.
Cloud,Kyrie's not coming. You'll have to make do with us.
Barret,Hah! That wasn't too much trouble.
Cloud,"Well enough. If they're smart, they won't send anyone else."
Barret,"Learn your lesson, girl?"
Barret,That ain't the lesson.
Tifa,"She say ""grandma""?"
Tifa,Wait a minute—you're the Angel!?
Barret,The Daily Buzz? You mean that trash filled with Shinra fluff pieces?
Barret,"Kinda, but hurry it up. We don't have time for a three-act play."
Cloud,Do you remember the death threat she left there?
Cloud,...What are you asking?
Barret,Okay then. Y'all think we got everything? Question is now what? It's not gonna be easy selling this stuff.
Tifa,"Oh, I know. What about Marle? We could ask her to help. I'm sure she'd be happy to."
Cloud,Gifts from an angel.
Tifa,They're to be used to help the people of Sector 7 rebuild.
Cloud,Never met her. Just her go-between.
Barret,"Hey, how's it going?"
Cloud,But no one else can do it.
Barret,Yeah! That's how it's done.
Barret,"I know it's tough right now, but stay strong, y'hear?"
Cloud,"For the last time, don't call me that."
Tifa,You're leaving?
Tifa,"Uh, okay..."
Tifa,"Good luck out there, Johnny."
Tifa,You'll be fine wherever. You're Johnny—don't forget!
Barret,"You are gonna hold up your end of the bargain, right?"
Barret,"I don't trust you, and I don't like you. So if you so much as breathe in a suspicious way...I'll turn that face of yours into a honeycomb."
Cloud,Let's get this over with.
Barret,The mark of Avalanche. Right. Jessie and Biggs stashed a skeleton key down here.
Tifa,I never got the chance to thank them for what they did.
Cloud,Tifa...
Tifa,"Let's just keep moving, okay?"
Barret,"Yeah, we heard you."
Barret,Made it. 'Bout time.
Tifa,Hey...wasn't this locked before?
Barret,"Yeah, yeah..."
Tifa,Can I ask you something? Why did you help us out before? You could've lost everything.
Tifa,That really it?
Tifa,Huh?
Barret,This it?
Cloud,So how we supposed to get topside?
Cloud,Then you're telling me we're not done?
Tifa,Huh?
Cloud,Let's go.
Barret,Bastard went that way!
Barret,Where in the hell did that thing run off to?
Barret,"We ain't got time to play hide-and-seek, ya little shit!"
Barret,"(chuckles) Gotcha now! So, gonna make us work for it, are ya! I'm not gonna hurt ya, little fella. So just stay st—"
Cloud,Take the right.
Tifa,I'm on it.
Barret,"Your days are numbered, ratboy!"
Tifa,He's so slippery!
Cloud,Just like his owner.
Tifa,That's...
Barret,That's not a key.
Barret,That's not your pendant either. Were they family?
Tifa,Why did you wanna come down here?
Cloud,"It's fine. As long as you get us topside, we're still in."
Barret,You all right.
Barret,That twisted piece of shit. I'm gonna enjoy beatin' him to a pulp.
Barret,Huh?
Cloud,Fine.
Barret,Think the kid's gonna be okay goin' it alone?
Cloud,"Think again, Don."
Barret,"You were talking 'bout the Sector 7 plan. Keep talking, asshole."
Barret,Don't try to bullshit us!
Barret,Bastard...
Cloud,"First him, then Cornei."
Cloud,You okay?
Barret,Sorry. Bastard got away.
Tifa,"You know, I wouldn't be so sure about that. She could still be out there."
Barret,Can never be sure how much someone means to ya till they're gone. Don't give up on her yet.
Tifa,"""We'll meet again."""
Tifa,"It's a symbol of ""reunion."""
Barret,Hold up. I think ya might be forgetting something.
Barret,Ahh! Taste that sweet Midgar smog!
Tifa,Thank you.
Barret,"Didn't tell you before, but we're looking for someone too."
Cloud,You too.
Barret,Let's go.
Barret,"Ready to do this? Once we start up that wall, we won't be comin' back here any time soon."
Barret,"We won't be comin' back here anytime soon. Best handle any unfinished business now, okay?"
Barret,"Hope you're ready now. No coming back, remember? Last chance to change your mind."
Barret,"So...when this is over, you gonna go on being a merc?"
Cloud,That's the plan.
Barret,Reckon it suits you.
Tifa,"Yeah, it does."
Barret,Used to think you were a little shit with a big attitude and a bigger inferiority complex. Quite possibly the worst person I have ever met. But that was before I figured you out. All this? It ain't you.
Tifa,"Deep down, you're a pretty nice guy. Didn't see it when we were kids, but..."
Cloud,"Don't know about any of that, but kindness is no use on the battlefield. If anything, it's a liability."
Barret,"Hey, no one's asking you to treat Shinra with kid gloves."
Tifa,Aerith's up there waiting for us.
Barret,"Then we better get a move on, huh?"
Cloud,Ready?
Barret,Two goals! Goal one! Kick some Shinra ass and save the planet! Goal two! Save the girl—while kicking more Shinra ass—and get out!
Cloud,Copy.
Barret,Gotta be careful. No tellin' what's gonna collapse or when.
Barret,See what I mean?
Tifa,A friend of ours needs help.
Cloud,"For you, maybe."
Tifa,So that's where we have to climb?
Barret,If it comes apart while we're up there...(imitates falling and splatting)
Cloud,"We've made it through worse, you know."
Barret,"Yeah, no kidding. It's a miracle we haven't been killed a dozen times over by now."
Barret,It's a dead end.
Tifa,Wonder if this rope belongs to search and rescue.
Barret,Think we might be able to climb up here.
Tifa,Time for the grappling guns. Try to aim for that part of the rope that's hanging there.
Barret,"Don't screw up and fall. By the way, how well you do with this grappling gun will tell us a whole lot about you."
Tifa,"(chuckles) Just remember, we can't come back down. Are you ready?"
Barret,I think I see a rope hanging off the top there.
Barret,"Too easy. This keeps up, I'm gonna get bored."
Cloud,Kill team.
Barret,We can take 'em.
Cloud,We need to stay on mission.
Barret,I know. Saving Aerith is our top priority.
Cloud,This is Hunter 2-2. Just had to put down a few monsters. Over.
Barret,Listen up! We ain't runnin' and we ain't hidin'! Y'all don't know the meaning of sufferin'! But you will!
Cloud,Call was over.
Barret,Not this guy again!
Tifa,Come on! We need to get inside!
Barret,Why don't we use our grappling guns to get up there? Jump over all this shit.
Cloud,Not much choice.
Barret,I guess everybody and their mothers knows we're here now.
Tifa,They'll be coming for us now.
Barret,"Well, to hell with being subtle!"
Tifa,What do you think? Can we climb it?
Barret,Sure—with a grappling gun.
Tifa,I just hope that this time it holds.
Barret,I think I see a rope hanging off the top there.
Barret,"Dammit. If any of this crumbles, we're all going down."
Tifa,No...
Barret,Don't you ever forget this view.
Barret,Just thinkin' about bustin' into Shinra HQ's got me fired up!
Cloud,Save some for later.
Barret,"No need, son. I've got more than enough to keep me goin' for days."
Barret,Don't look down. You can do this. Don't look down. Just keep going. Don't look down. Don't look down!
Cloud,Hide!
Barret,That son of a bitch is back!? I thought we lost him!
Barret,Dammit! Looks like there's only one way to go.
Cloud,We were headed that way anyway.
Barret,You want some of this? Then come get it!
Tifa,Cloud...
Barret,I guess...we'll build another bar.
Tifa,Yeah. We will.
Tifa,"You'll help too, won't you?"
Cloud,For a price.
Cloud,Run!
Barret,"Run, dammit, run! Move your ass!"
Barret,Shit! Look out!
Barret,Was gettin' tired of playing tag anyway!
Cloud,C'mon!
Cloud,You okay!?
Tifa,Cloud!
Cloud,Grab on!
Barret,That was close!
Cloud,It's not done with us yet.
Barret,"Yeah, I hear ya. Let's blow the bitch outta the sky!"
Barret,What the hell!?
Barret,Oh you gotta be shittin' me.
Cloud,Don't get caught in the open.
Barret,(chuckles) We win again. Not that there was ever any doubt! (chuckles)
Barret,Now what?
Cloud,Shit!
Cloud,Tifa!
Tifa,Barret!
Barret,There's such a thing as too much excitement.
Tifa,Yeah. And there's still more to come.
Barret,Guess so.
Cloud,Hope everybody's warmed up.
Barret,Rolled out the welcome wagon.
Tifa,"Gotta say, I can't help but wonder if this is a lost cause."
Barret,"Well, ya know, some lose causes are worth fighting for."
Cloud,Let's just think this through.
Barret,"So. I got an idea. Frontal assault, guns blazing. Make for a good story."
Cloud,Why'd we bring you along again?
Cloud,Rear entrance. We'll get inside via the parking garage.
Tifa,Security's looking pretty tight.
Barret,Ha! So they know what they're up against.
Cloud,Somehow I don't think it's all for us. Could be for Avalanche. Or maybe even Wutai.
Barret,Can't be for Wutai. What about the cease-fire?
Cloud,That only put the war on pause.
Barret,"Either way, I'm gonna put the fear of Avalanche in 'em! Their days of sittin' smug in this glass tower are over!"
Cloud,"We're here to rescue Aerith, remember? We don't need much more attention than what we're gonna get. We need to be smart."
Barret,"Yeah, I hear ya! But my soul's screaming for payback, you know? I'm a tickin' time bomb, and sooner or later, I'mma have to blow up!"
Cloud,"Well, then make it later."
Tifa,"That one there—that's a Shinra truck, isn't it?"
Cloud,C'mon.
Barret,"So far, so good. (screams)"
Barret,Ha! Bring it on!
Cloud,The idea was to not get noticed.
Barret,Stealth ain't my style.
Cloud,You never planned to be stealthy in the first place.
Barret,"Don't remember. Maybe, maybe not."
Barret,It's feelin' like a proper party now!
Cloud,(sighs) Let's keep moving. Should be a service entrance in the back.
Barret,That's that.
Tifa,Sure hope no one else knows we're here.
Cloud,Come on. We need to move.
Barret,Nobody's home.
Cloud,Yeah.
Tifa,Do you have any idea where they might be holding Aerith?
Cloud,I'm thinking a research facility. That'd make the most sense.
Barret,And where is that?
Cloud,Upper floors...maybe near the top... That's where you are.
Barret,Maybe!?
Tifa,Maybe we can use the console at the reception desk to find out.
Tifa,This building's incredible.
Barret,Hah! A shining monument to corporate greed. One of these days I'm gonna tear it down and burn the rubble.
Cloud,But not today.
Barret,"Yeah, yeah."
Tifa,"I don't know about you, but I don't think we should try touching it."
Barret,Shit. Making life hard.
Cloud,Let's just keep heading up.
Cloud,Either the elevator or the emergency stairwell.
Barret,Isn't the lab we're looking for on one of the top floors? I vote we take the elevator.
Barret,"No getting upstairs without a keycard, huh?"
Tifa,Think we're gonna need a few before this is over.
Cloud,Pretty sure I saw one lying around.
Barret,The reception desk!
Cloud,"Yeah, but how to get in?"
Tifa,"Go up and over, maybe?"
Tifa,Look. Pretty sure we could reach it if we hop across those lights.
Barret,I don't know...
Tifa,"I think I'll give it a shot. As the lightest one here, I figure I've got the best chance. You two can sit back and watch."
Tifa,"Okay, guys. Wish me luck."
Barret,You be careful.
Tifa,Aren't I always?
Cloud,Tifa!
Barret,Oh shit! Tifa!
Cloud,Are you okay!?
Tifa,I thought I was dead for sure!
Tifa,"Hand over hand, huh? That's fine, bring it on."
Tifa,This isn't so bad. Pretty close now. Just need to make it over there.
Tifa,Almost there. Just need to get across those platforms.
Barret,That's some fine work.
Tifa,Ah! I might be able to disable security from here.
Tifa,Huh?
Barret,"Ha! Hot damn, girl."
Tifa,But I didn't do anything...
Barret,"Shit, I'll take it. So you can use that to look up what floor the research facility's on?"
Tifa,I think so. Gimme a sec.
Tifa,"Bingo. Professor Hojo's lab. 65th floor, looks like."
Tifa,Huh. Guess we can only get to the 59th floor via the elevators or stairs. To access any level above that. we need to check in at the Skyview Hall reception.
Cloud,"59th floor it is, then."
Barret,Right.
Barret,So what can we expect further up?
Cloud,More security and restrictions. It's not gonna get any easier.
Barret,Huh?
Barret,Wasn't expectin' that.
Tifa,Think anyone knows we're here?
Cloud,"Nah, we took 'em down quick."
Tifa,Wonder if it'll stop again.
Barret,People oughta try using the damn stairs sometime!
Cloud,"If it happens again, we'll deal with it like before. We got this."
Barret,"Well that didn't take long, did it?"
Barret,Straight on up to the top now. C'mon.
Tifa,"We just keep getting waylaid, don't we?"
Cloud,If you wanna take the stairs...
Barret,Now that you mention it... No.
Cloud,Heads up. Could be trouble.
Tifa,Right. Normal people work here too.
Barret,She probably called for help.
Barret,Who's it gonna be next?
Tifa,"A whole lotta mormal people with families and friends work for Shinra. People just trying to support their loved ones as best they can. I know it's not exactly a revelation, but... It's easy to forget."
Barret,A good man who serves a great evil is not without sin. He must recognize and accept his complicity. He must open his eyes to the truth—that his corporate masters are profiting from the planet's pain. Only then can he redeem himself. I know you know this.
Tifa,I do.
Cloud,Tifa. We need to focus on saving Aerith.
Tifa,I know. I will.
Barret,You have got to be shittin' me.
Cloud,Nope. We're a lot less likely to get caught this way.
Barret,But a lot more likely to die of boredom.
Cloud,It's only fifty-nine floors.
Tifa,Nothing to it.
Barret,"Well, at least it ain't a race. Small blessing."
Tifa,Wonder what it's like up there.
Cloud,More security and restrictions. It's not gonna get any easier.
Barret,We're gonna be exhausted by the time we finally get to the top.
Cloud,"Long as you pace yourself, you'll be fine."
Barret,Maybe we should take a quick break.
Tifa,"C'mon, Barret."
Barret,You can stop if you want. Can even say it's for me.
Cloud,Just say you can't hack it.
Barret,"I'll hack you, jackass!"
Tifa,That's enough from both of you. Stupid arguments aren't going to get us there faster.
Cloud,"But Tifa, I wasn't—"
Tifa,Not now. Save it for the top!
Barret,Guess these labs...and shit...are all the way at the very top?
Cloud,Yep. The very top.
Barret,That's...good to know...
Tifa,Cloud! Keep an eye on Barret!
Cloud,Copy.
Tifa,What was that? I don't think I heard you. Speak up!
Cloud,I'll keep an eye on Barret!
Barret,Thanks for the assist.
Cloud,Whatever.
Barret,I said...wait up!
Tifa,"Hey, guys! Where are you!?"
Barret,Hey! Just a few floors behind you!
Tifa,Oh? You're sounding better!
Barret,"Think I've got, like, a stairclimber's high!"
Tifa,Glad to hear it!
Cloud,You tired?
Tifa,I was. But I'm feeling okay now.
Barret,Hahhh... Hahhh... Hahhh... Then what're we waitin' for!? Let's roll!
Tifa,You really are doing better!
Barret,Hahhh... We...we gotta keep movin' (laughs)...to keep movin'! Hahhh...
Tifa,Hard to argue with that. Let's go.
Barret,"But tell me, these stairs...are these stairs ever gonna end!?"
Tifa,I dunno! Ask the stairs!
Cloud,I don't think the stairs are talking.
Barret,"Well, duh. I mean...duh."
Cloud,I was joking.
Tifa,That's enough from both of you.
Barret,Worst route ever. Gimme a suicidal last stand. At least— At least—at least that'd have an end!
Cloud,Let's shut up.
Tifa,"Yes, let's."
Barret,Why?
Tifa,Because wishing for trouble might bring it.
Cloud,Yup. And you're in no state to fight anyway.
Barret,So...what should I do?
Cloud,Shut up and move.
Barret,This sucks! I wanna go back!
Tifa,You wanna go down all those stairs you just climbed?
Barret,"Another day, another struggle... Climbing stairs is so much trouble."
Barret,"Cloud, slow down!"
Tifa,...The end.
Barret,Made it.
Cloud,The real challenge starts now. Okay. Let's go.
Barret,"So this is the Skyview Hall, huh? Bet this place cost a fortune and then some."
Cloud,Let's look for reception.
Barret,Hey! Check it out.
Tifa,"Come take a look, Cloud."
Barret,Damn fools.
Tifa,Hm?
Barret,"Ones who come here at night to ""take in the view."" So pretty and marvelous and beautiful! But every little light burning bright runs off her blood. And bit by bit they bleed her, never stoppin' to think how it'll end for them."
Tifa,Yeah.
Barret,"Terrible, but beautiful all the same."
Barret,Why's this whole thing gotta be such a big pain in the ass?
Tifa,"I don't know about you, but this is kinda weird."
Cloud,You think everything's going too well?
Tifa,"Yeah, I do. Think this is a trap?"
Barret,"Ha! If it is, then bring it on. Let's get this party started!"
Barret,"Man, why we gotta get all these damn keycards just to get anywhere?"
Cloud,This is Shinra HQ. The hell did you expect?
Barret,"Says the former company man himself. Guess you'd know about all the rules, regulations, and red tape—it's like coming home, huh?"
Barret,"Oh, hell no."
Barret,"Yeah, yeah. Shut up."
Tifa,I think I just threw up a little.
Barret,Man thinks very highly of himself.
Tifa,These all look so familiar.
Barret,Cause we've destroyed a bunch of 'em already.
Barret,Nothin' but a buncha lies!
Cloud,Except that mako has made people's lives better.
Barret,It's made people blind. Blind to the cold hard truth. Even I used to buy into their bullshit. Rememberin' that...makes me even madder.
Barret,This place is empty.
Barret,The hell—!?
Barret,That it?
Cloud,No!
Cloud,Sephiroth...
Barret,"Crazy-ass thing made me wanna puke. And not just 'cause of the presentation, but the content too. Oughta come with a warning! That ain't for kids!"
Cloud,That wasn't just a movie.
Tifa,That huge meteor... What was that about?
Barret,Like I said—nothing you should show a kid.
Barret,What the—!?
Barret,The mayor of Midgar? The empty suit that's just a mouthpiece for Shinra?
Cloud,So what does the mayor want with us?
Barret,Guess we're supposed to follow.
Barret,Look at this place! So what—you telling me the mayor's some kind of crazy bookworm?
Barret,"If this is a trap, you're a dead man, y'hear?"
Barret,This can't be right.
Cloud,What the hell's going on?
Barret,Say what?
Barret,"Huh. Well, this oughta make things easier."
Tifa,We need to break into Professor Hojo's lab.
Cloud,We're here to save a friend who was taken.
Barret,But the president's gonna get his too—if I have anything to say about it.
Barret,Great.
Barret,Hold up. You telling me that that's the best you can do?
Cloud,But you're the mayor.
Barret,"Okay! They did you wrong, like us—but we'll make it right. So just calm down. Deep breaths, man. Deep breaths."
Barret,And then what are we supposed to do?
Cloud,"So, can you tell us anything about this collaborator?"
Barret,You want money!
Barret,"Rip us off more, why don'tcha?"
Barret,That really all you got for us?
Barret,Huh?
Barret,That's better.
Tifa,I still can't believe the mayor is working with Avalanche.
Barret,Would've been nice to know. Idiots at HQ shoulda kept us in the loop.
Aerith,(gasps)
Barret,"Here's the 63rd floor, where loyal Shinra employees relax and recharge!"
Tifa,"It's pretty late, but I bet people are still here dealing with the aftermath of Sector 7."
Barret,It's their own damn fault.
Cloud,Stay focused. We need to find this guy.
Barret,"Yeah, yeah. Guess I better get working on my conversation skills."
Tifa,They look busy.
Cloud,A plate did just fall.
Tifa,Seeing them like this somehow makes me feel a little bit better.
Cloud,Let's find our contact.
Barret,Not seeing any security around. One less thing to worry about.
Barret,Where are you...mister collaborator...
Tifa,I think we just need to start talking to people who look the part.
Barret,"Remember, say ""mayor."""
Tifa,"If they say ""the best,"" then we have a winner."
Barret,The hell's that?
Cloud,Combat sim. You can use it to train for battle in a virtual space.
Barret,Does training in that thing really make you better?
Cloud,The mayor.
Cloud,The mayor.
Cloud,Never mind.
Cloud,The mayor.
Cloud,The mayor.
Cloud,The mayor.
Cloud,The mayor.
Cloud,The mayor.
Cloud,The mayor.
Barret,That's right.
Barret,Say what?
Cloud,We came to get one of our friends. She's being held in a research lab somewhere.
Cloud,We'll find a way in. Know where we can find Hojo?
Barret,Think they like surprises? We can even take the president as a hostage. Think of the leverage!
Cloud,We need to find out what they're planning.
Cloud,Thanks for the tip.
Barret,Old buddy?
Tifa,You okay?
Cloud,Yeah.
Tifa,But you were just—
Cloud,I'm good. Let's keep moving.
Barret,Dammit!
Tifa,Barret.
Barret,"Yeah, yeah, I know. We came here to save Aerith. That's our first priority."
Cloud,"That's right. We only get one chance. Hojo should be at that board meeting, so that'll buy us some time. We need to plan this just right."
Tifa,What's the plan?
Cloud,Little bit of recon. Need to find a way to infiltrate that room.
Barret,You hear the words comin' out of your mouth? We just gotta find that bathroom so we can get into the air duct. Ask anyone here. They can point us in the right direction.
Cloud,"No, thanks. We can find it on our own."
Tifa,"All right, I'll wait out here."
Barret,Huh? You can't hang out here.
Cloud,Tifa. It'd be better if you waited inside.
Tifa,"Maybe, but this is... Oh...never mind, you're right."
Tifa,"Oh, thank god. No one's in here."
Barret,Love to show them what the ones down below look like.
Tifa,"Come on, let's just find that duct."
Cloud,Gotcha.
Barret,"Look, I'm..."
Cloud,On guard duty.
Barret,Right.
Tifa,So...can I go with you? Don't wanna be here any longer than I have to.
Cloud,"Yeah, sure. Just follow behind."
Cloud,This it?
Barret,Anything?
Cloud,The man in the lab coat. Head of R&D. We follow him.
Barret,Okay. And then we kill the son of a bitch.
Cloud,Not until he's led us to Aerith. That's the plan.
Cloud,Let's go.
Barret,Right.
Barret,Don't move! I ain't bluffing.
Barret,"A dozen bullets in your head, unless you open that door right now."
Barret,Shut up. Keep walking.
Barret,None of y'all better move a muscle!
Barret,You'll get used to it.
Barret,Our friend. She's in your lab.
Barret,Tell us where Aerith is!
Barret,Mind speaking up some?
Barret,Hey! Hojo's getting away!
Cloud,Aerith!
Barret,"Cocky little egghead, ain'tcha."
Barret,Y'all 'bout to learn predictable.
Cloud,We're taking Aerith back!
Barret,She only came here to save Marlene!
Barret,Looks like your models got it wrong.
Cloud,But will they get here in time to save you from me?
Cloud,Yeah.
Barret,What are those things up to this time?
Aerith,Cloud!
Cloud,Barret!
Barret,Got it. Stand back.
Aerith,You came for me.
Cloud,Yep.
Tifa,You good?
Aerith,I'm great!
Barret,Thanks for saving Marlene. I owe you one.
Cloud,Save it for later!
Tifa,Aerith! You okay?
Aerith,Mm-hm. Thank you.
Cloud,Let's get outta here.
Barret,The hell was that thing?
Aerith,We need to go!
Tifa,Aerith!
Barret,What the—!?
Cloud,Come on.
Barret,What? You wanna go?
Aerith,Stop. This child's a friend.
Barret,Uhh... So what the hell is it?
Tifa,Did it just talk?
Tifa,Thirteen?
Tifa,Then...you must have another name. What is it?
Cloud,He got away.
Barret,"So, we gonna go get the son of a bitch?"
Cloud,Je...no... Oh... Ah...
Cloud,Mo...ther...
Tifa,Cloud.
Aerith,"Oh, thank goodness. You're awake."
Tifa,You okay?
Cloud,Yeah. Where are we?
Aerith,Where I lived—when I was still a child.
Aerith,"My mom and I stayed here, years ago when I was just a little girl. The room...looks exactly the same."
Aerith,"Every morning, they'd come and take my mom away. I remember crying here alone."
Cloud,"...Aerith. Before we break outta here, talk to us. There's so much we don't know."
Aerith,"I'm...a descendent of the Ancients. That's pretty much it, really. Oh, but just so you know, that's not their actual name. They called themselves...the Cetra."
Barret,"""We who are born of the planet, with her we speak. Her flesh we shape."" ""Unto her promised land she well one day return."" ""By her loving grace and providence may we take our place in paradise."""
Aerith,You know it!
Barret,"Yeah, well... Honestly I thought that part was just a fairy tale."
Aerith,Shinra thinks it's true. They've been searching for the promised land for a long time.
Tifa,And they must think you can lead them to it... Can you?
Aerith,"(sighs) Nope. Someday, maybe, I'll find it in me. But now? Not even if I wanted to."
Barret,"Even if you could, that land belongs to the—I mean... To you and your people. Shinra's after it because they believe it's rich in mako—mako they've got no right to claim. But they'll try to take it anyway, won't they? Hmph. Greedy bastards'll never stop."
Barret,"Okay. New plan. Y'all take Aerith and get the hell outta here. Me, I'mma go bust some Shinra heads."
Aerith,"Barret, wait... You can't do that..."
Barret,"Oh, great. These assholes again! Probably some Shinra science experiment."
Tifa,"Like capital D... ""Destiny""?"
Tifa,And you're saying that that flow is somehow...fixed?
Barret,"So if we're destined for a bleak future, these Whispers will try to keep us on that course? Now wait just a damn minute! How in the hell can you possibly know any of that? Spouting that cryptic stuff—which could all be bullshit! I mean, ain't you a Shinra lab rat—dog?"
Aerith,Listen to me! Please...
Cloud,Aerith.
Aerith,"The Shinra Electric Power Company isn't the real enemy. It started with them, sure...but I promise you...there's a much bigger threat. I just want to do everything in my power to help. All of you... And the planet."
Tifa,Aerith. What are you not telling us?
Aerith,"I'm lost in a maze, and...every step is taking me further from the path... Every time the Whispers touch me...I lose something. A part of myself. ""Follow them. The yellow flowers."""
Tifa,It's okay. We'll find a way out together.
Aerith,Okay.
Barret,Weird...
Barret,Wedge!?
Tifa,You're here!?
Barret,Y-you shouldn't be up and moving!
Tifa,What was that? An explosion?
Tifa,So now we're trapped in here?
Barret,HQ's bailing us out? I doubt it. Not after all the shit we've pulled.
Tifa,"Thanks, Wedge."
Barret,I didn't ask him to do any of that.
Cloud,"Yeah, well, I'm glad he did."
Barret,Huh? Heh. I'mma still chew him out for it later.
Barret,"Anyway, we gotta get to the roof, right?"
Barret,That elevator. Was it this way?
Barret,What happened here?
Aerith,The little ones in the pods. Where did they go?
Barret,Now what do we do?
Cloud,Someone's picking a fight.
Barret,So go give 'em one already!
Cloud,Way ahead of you!
Barret,Nice job!
Barret,What?
Barret,Shit—what the hell Red!?
Cloud,Cool.
Cloud,So...what are you gonna do now?
Cloud,Let's go.
Tifa,Right.
Barret,Hell is this place?
Barret,What I wouldn't give to burn it all down...but we need to get to the roof.
Barret,What is that...?
Aerith,Jenova.
Tifa,Cloud?
Cloud,Tell me. Is it really you?
Sephiroth,Don't deny me. Embrace me.
Cloud,(screams)
Aerith,Cloud!
Sephiroth,A touching reunion.
Cloud,I'd better hurry.
Cloud,Test subject pods? Guess I can use these.
Cloud,Thanks.
Cloud,Yeah. Where're the others?
Cloud,Let's go.
Cloud,"If we flip that switch, we can get to the other side."
Cloud,You sure?
Barret,What kind of freak show have they got going on in here?
Barret,Stay back!
Cloud,Need hand?
Barret,"Yeah, right! Just having a little bit of fun with them, that's all."
Cloud,For how long?
Barret,Long as it took you to get here?
Barret,"Shit, it's like they're churning out monsters here."
Barret,Hey... You okay?
Cloud,Yeah. I'm fine...
Barret,If you say so.
Cloud,Guess we're out.
Barret,"First, we find Tifa and Aerith. Then we head for the roof. Should be an elevator somewhere. Didn't expect any of this, but we just gotta roll with it. Come on, let's go."
Barret,All right. Now you're starting to impress me.
Aerith,We got 'em!
Barret,"Yeah! Keep it up, y'all!"
Aerith,Don't move an inch! We'll head down too. Be right there!
Barret,Huh? I can't hear what you're saying!
Tifa,Hello? Cloud? Can you hear me?
Cloud,Yeah. You okay in there?
Tifa,"No need to worry. We're fine, but what do we do now? I don't see any way out of this room."
Barret,What!?
Barret,"""Necessary preparations""? What the hell is this asshole talking about?"
Tifa,Can't we just ignore him and keep going?
Tifa,"He said something about a ward, right? I'm pretty sure I saw a door to one upstairs somewhere."
Aerith,So...you wanna check it out?
Cloud,You two'll be on your own. Be careful.
Tifa,Thanks. We will.
Barret,We'll be waiting right here. If anything happens—anything at all—you call us. All right?
Aerith,Roger that!
Tifa,"Hey, you think Cloud's doing okay? He's been acting really weird lately—more than usual."
Aerith,"True, but it's Cloud—I'm sure he'll be fine. But what about you, Tifa? How are you holding up?"
Tifa,Huh? Oh (chuckles) I'm fine!
Tifa,"I guess this has to be the 3rd ward, right?"
Aerith,Think so. But it looks like the door's locked.
Tifa,There has to be something we can do. Let's look around.
Aerith,Gotcha.
Aerith,Look! Now they can get across too.
Tifa,We should let Cloud know.
Tifa,"Cloud, can you hear me? We found the door to that ward he was talking about, but it's locked and we can't get it open."
Cloud,All right.
Aerith,About those preparations Hojo mentioned before... I think we're supposed to do something with that.
Aerith,We were fiddling with some sort of control panel. Do you see a way to get across now?
Cloud,All right. We'll make our way to the central terminal. Sit tight until you hear from us.
Barret,"The hell kind of ""research"" is this?"
Barret,I don't give a shit about any of that.
Barret,Hmph! So this asshole thinks he can treat us like his experiments.
Barret,Wait sec. Weren't the girls right by the door to the 3rd ward?
Barret,What the—?
Cloud,"Tifa, you there? We accessed the central terminal. The door should be unlocked now."
Cloud,Any one of Hojo's twisted creations could be in that ward. Be careful.
Tifa,We will. See you in a bit.
Tifa,"Uh, what is this place for?"
Aerith,There's a...sadness...
Aerith,Look.
Tifa,Let's get across with those.
Aerith,That hurt. Did we wake 'em up?
Tifa,"Yeah, looks like it."
Tifa,Is this really the exit?
Aerith,I hate that man. I really do.
Tifa,You think now the others can get across too?
Tifa,"Hey, Cloud?"
Cloud,Tifa?
Tifa,"We used the control panel here a little while ago, so you should be able to get to the other side. Can you check?"
Barret,Roger that. Was gettin' pretty bored anyway.
Cloud,"You two, stay there. We'll call if anything comes up."
Aerith,Okay. Be careful.
Cloud,More of Hojo's experiments.
Barret,Why don'tcha come down here and ask me?
Barret,Hey! We ain't done yet!
Barret,How'd ya like watchin' your precious toys get torn to shreds!?
Barret,Look! Now's our chance to kill the bastard! Time for you to pay the piper!
Barret,Shit. Looks like Red might need our help up there!
Barret,C'mon! We're going!
Barret,Get outta here!
Barret,What was that thing?
Cloud,Where's Hojo?
Cloud,Forget about him for now.
Barret,"Remind me. This ain't a hospital, is it?"
Cloud,They're enhanced...or dissected.
Barret,This guy's a real piece of work...
Barret,Now what!?
Barret,"Hey, let us out!"
Barret,I remember you!
Barret,Fine! One step at a time it is.
Cloud,I'll let Tifa and Aerith know.
Barret,"Huh, whaddya know. That's the door to the 4th ward."
Barret,But the door we used to get here is shut. So what now?
Cloud,The passages have to be connected somehow.
Cloud,Please.
Barret,"It's a PHS terminal. Call up Tifa, see if they can get to the central terminal."
Barret,Hey! You okay down there?
Cloud,Red!
Barret,Shit! He can't hold them off forever!
Barret,You should call Tifa.
Cloud,Right. On it.
Cloud,"Tifa, you there?"
Tifa,Is something wrong?
Cloud,Red fell to your level. Can you try to get to him?
Aerith,"Oh, no!"
Tifa,Come on!
Aerith,Sorry for the wait!
Tifa,"Now, let's get this over with!"
Tifa,Let's finish this!
Tifa,You okay?
Barret,Nice one!
Tifa,Have Cloud and Barret found anything?
Aerith,Maybe we can get to it instead.
Tifa,"Yeah, let's try."
Aerith,Look! An elevator!
Aerith,...And it's not moving.
Aerith,"For the record, I don't like this one bit."
Tifa,This was a good idea...right?
Aerith,Yep! Let's go give the others the news.
Cloud,That you?
Tifa,Yeah. We found an elevator on our side.
Cloud,Good. Glad to hear it.
Tifa,But...we can't use it for some reason.
Aerith,Hojo did something. I know it.
Tifa,We unlocked it on our side. You should be able to get in.
Cloud,Thanks. Wait for us there.
Barret,Right. Now we head back to that door.
Barret,"We, uh, made Wedge wait a while to be rescued."
Cloud,Guess so.
Barret,"You know, he really likes you."
Cloud,Maybe.
Barret,"Friendly guy, but he has a hard time opening up to people."
Cloud,Well...that makes two of us.
Barret,"He's got your back, though. Heh...makes two of us."
Cloud,Run!
Barret,Flyin' fishbot here's trying to turn us into mincemeat!
Barret,It's outta control!
Cloud,Dammit!
Tifa,What the—!?
Aerith,I think it's coming this way!
Aerith,That's enough.
Aerith,Yes! We got it to work.
Tifa,Could this be a trap?
Aerith,Don't worry. The elevators are safe.
Tifa,All right. If you say so.
Tifa,Huh? Are we there already?
Aerith,"No, something tells me that we aren't. Call it a hunch."
Barret,"We don't have all day, you know."
Tifa,I think it might be locked from this side.
Aerith,Should we open it up then?
Barret,Uh... Cloud...
Aerith,"Heya, guys!"
Barret,Oh...hey. Band's back together. Past time we got outta here and made our way to the roof.
Tifa,"Well, okay then. Looks like the elevator's working."
Barret,(laughs) Glad to hear he enjoyed the show.
Tifa,We're back...again.
Cloud,Yeah.
Barret,Hey.
Barret,What the hell's going on?
Tifa,Who would...?
Cloud,Let's go.
Barret,So what's above this floor?
Aerith,"Wait. Once we get in that elevator, there's no turning back."
Tifa,We're ready...right?
Cloud,Huh?
Cloud,I'm ready to do this. Let's go.
Barret,Where the hell is that bastard hiding?
Tifa,And Sephiroth?
Barret,"Well, well, well..."
Barret,"Thing is, I don't want your money."
Barret,I'm a man of modest dreams. Dropping you from seventy stories up would get me damn near to good.
Barret,More than this right here? Talk to me again like you know me.
Tifa,Barret!
Aerith,Stop it!
Barret,"You're gonna get on TV and tell 'em. Tell 'em what you did to Sector 7—that it was you who killed all those people! Then, you're gonna tell them the truth about Avalanche. That Avalanche ain't Wutai or anybody's puppet! That Avaalnche fights for the people—the planet! That we fight to hold Shinra to account for its crimes! That is Avalanche! The filthy sewer rats...who brought down a goliath! You tell 'em that."
Barret,Huh? Damn.
Barret,And what about you Mister President. What are your vaunted principles?
Barret,You son of a bitch!
Tifa,Barret!
Aerith,The source. Of everything.
Tifa,What's happening!?
Tifa,Barret! Are you hurt!?
Barret,Don't think so.
Barret,Thanks.
Cloud,Sephiroth!
Cloud,Everyone okay?
Barret,Hey. Get your man?
Cloud,He got away.
Barret,Huh. 'Bout time we made our escape too.
Cloud,Shit.
Barret,If it ain't Rufus Shinra. Heir to the throne himself.
Cloud,Yep.
Cloud,Stop.
Barret,Huh!? The hell I will! We can finish off the family here and now!
Cloud,Take Aerith and get outta here.
Cloud,I'll buy you guys some time.
Barret,I could stay here—back you up.
Cloud,Barret...I'm asking you. Please.
Barret,Fine. Have it your way then. But you better be right behind us.
Cloud,Ex-SOLDIER. I quit.
Cloud,Let's get this over with.
Cloud,Think you got my number?
Cloud,That's a new trick.
Cloud,Now it's just the two of us.
Cloud,It's on for real now?
Cloud,I could end this—here and now.
Tifa,You gotta be better than this...if you're gonna play the hero.
Barret,You've seen the both in action. You know they can. Besides—
Barret,What was that!?
Barret,Gotta believe they made it out.
Aerith,I hope so.
Barret,Dammit!
Barret,Screw it—we gotta go back!
Barret,"What, Red!?"
Barret,Get down!
Barret,Hey. Still in one piece?
Aerith,Yeah. Somehow.
Barret,"Oh, you gotta be kidding me!"
Barret,"Okay, you asked for it, mech! Open wide! And suck on this!"
Barret,"I was born ready, Red."
Barret,We piss it off?
Aerith,This doesn't look good!
Barret,Any ideas!?
Aerith,They all just...flew off.
Barret,"If more come, we're done."
Barret,Not this again!
Aerith,We can't hide! What do we do!?
Barret,"Damn, does it feel good to be alive!"
Barret,The hell they are!
Aerith,You're right. Let's go.
Barret,All we gotta do now is find the others.
Barret,Avalanche!
Aerith,Local florist!
Barret,Up your ass.
Barret,Aerith. You saved my Marlene. Now...it's time I returned the favor.
Aerith,Wait!
Aerith,Cloud!
Tifa,"Everyone, get in!"
Cloud,Let's roll.
Tifa,Okay!
Barret,Why's he always gotta— Whoa! Shit.
Barret,"Home free, Red!"
Barret,"Man, you need to lighten up. Hell, you might even try smiling."
Barret,"On second thought...maybe frowning suits you better. Hey, don't pout!"
Barret,Whoa! Are you guys seeing this!?
Aerith,Whispers.
Barret,It's like the whole damn building's made of 'em.
Cloud,Yeah.
Tifa,I don't understand. What are they doing?
Aerith,Who knows...
Barret,Wedge—you don't think he got caught up in it do you?
Tifa,"If he did, I hope he's okay..."
Barret,Who?
Barret,"This, we don't need."
Cloud,Time to go!
Barret,"They're gainin' on us! C'mon, step on it!"
Tifa,"I'm trying, but it won't go any faster!"
Barret,How the hell'd we get saddled with this junker!?
Barret,No...dammit...
Barret,Stubborn bastards!
Aerith,Look!
Tifa,Come on!
Barret,(laughs) And let that be a lesson to you!
Cloud,Heads up!
Barret,That chopper is all mine! I'll bring it down real quick!
Barret,"(laughs) Try catching us now, ya bastards!"
Aerith,What the—!?
Barret,Cloud! Keep your guard up!
Barret,That's it! Now seize the opening and attack!
Barret,Ha ha ha! How do you like that!?
Cloud,Get down!
Barret,Them again!?
Barret,Guess we owe you another!
Barret,"Shit! We got incoming! I'll take the chopper! The bikes are all yours, Cloud!"
Barret,"Ha! Think you can take us? Well think again, asshole!"
Barret,That's it—I'm takin' you down!
Barret,We done here!?
Cloud,You good?
Aerith,Somehow!
Barret,So now...they're on our side?
Barret,"Oh no, don't you dare!"
Barret,C'mon! You see the piece of shit we're driving here!?
Barret,Hey!
Tifa,Focus!
Aerith,I don't want any trouble!
Barret,Time to meet your maker!
Barret,"Okay, y'all! Let's finish him off! C'mon!"
Cloud,Copy! Go for the head.
Barret,Nice!
Barret,"Okay, asshole, let's—"
Aerith,Don't.
Aerith,And you... You're wrong.
Sephiroth,Those who look with clouded eyes see nothing but shadows.
Aerith,Everything about you is wrong.
Sephiroth,"All born are bound to her. Should this world be unmade, so too shall her children."
Cloud,The world won't end today. But you... You will.
Sephiroth,Listen.
Sephiroth,Destiny come.
Sephiroth,"I'm waiting, Cloud."
Aerith,This is the point of no return.
Aerith,Destiny's crossroads.
Cloud,Then why did you stop me?
Aerith,I'm not really sure.
Tifa,What will we find on the other side?
Aerith,"Freedom. Boundless, terrifying freedom. Like a great, never-ending sky. What you heard just now were the voices of the planet. Those born into this world. Who lived and who died. Who returned. They're howling in pain."
Cloud,Because of him? Sephiroth?
Aerith,"They... Their words...they don't reach him. All these moments and memories, precious and fleeting...they're like rain rolling off his back... And when they're gone, he won't cry...or shout...or anything. He'd tell you that he only cares about the planet. That he'd do everything in his power to protect and preserve it. But this isn't the way it's supposed to be. There's no greater threat to the planet than him. Sephiroth has to be stopped. He has to be. And that's why... I'm asking you to help me. I know that together, we can do this. But if we do... We'll be changing more than fate itself. If we succeed...if we win...we'll be changing ourselves... I guess...maybe, that's why I hesitated."
Cloud,"You said it yourself. He has to be stopped. And frankly, I've heard enough howling for a lifetime."
Aerith,Ready?
Tifa,Never tried to challenge destiny.
Cloud,Let's go.
Barret,Wouldn't be the first time I spit in destiny's eye. Whether you can see the seams or you can't...doesn't change that she's always trying to have it her way.
Barret,"Daddy's coming home real soon, honey!"
Barret,"Don't know about you, but looks normal to me."
Aerith,Over there.
Barret,"Okay, that ain't right!"
Barret,You're alive!
Cloud,Happy to see me?
Barret,Wouldn't go that far.
Cloud,"So that thing...that's a Whisper too, huh?"
Barret,"Looks a lot more like an ""arbiter of fate"" than the others."
Tifa,We can beat them.
Barret,Ha! Bring it on!
Barret,"Come on, that ain't fair!"
Cloud,Run!
Barret,We gotta go!
Cloud,Just go!
Barret,"Shit! Look out! Run dammit, run! Move your ass!"
Tifa,Dammit!
Barret,We gotta get outta here now!
Barret,Did we do it!?
Aerith,Hang on!
Tifa,Aerith!
Barret,What the hell did I just see?
Barret,Dammit! How do we stop these things!?
Cloud,These guys are right here.
Tifa,This can't be our future...
Aerith,The future is always a blank page.
Barret,Them again? Least they could do is give us a little breather!
Cloud,I say we split up. Take 'em down at the same time.
Barret,"In that case, ultra big boy's all mine!"
Cloud,"Bring it on, bitch!"
Cloud,Let's do this.
Tifa,Right!
Aerith,We can do this—together!
Aerith,"Barret, we're counting on you!"
Barret,Ain't no stoppin' us now!
Barret,Gotcha!
Aerith,"Red, you're up!"
Barret,I'm gonna show you what Avalanche is made of!
Tifa,"Barret, go for it!"
Aerith,We did it!
Tifa,Right.
Cloud,Where are we?
Sephiroth,"I'm waiting, Cloud."
Barret,What the hell is this!?
Cloud,Sephiroth...
Cloud,Let's finish this.
Sephiroth,"Fate is not to be taken lightly, Cloud."
Cloud,Shut up!
Tifa,Need some help?
Cloud,Don't know about need... Good to go?
Tifa,You know it!
Aerith,Did you miss me?
Cloud,Not really. He's tough.
Aerith,"Yeah, so what? Screw him."
Aerith,Tifa!
Tifa,What'd I miss?
Tifa,Aerith!
Aerith,Sorry I'm late!
Tifa,Barret!
Barret,Ain't you two havin' fun!
Aerith,Barret!
Barret,Better late than never!
Cloud,Let's go.
Tifa,Barret!
Aerith,Welcome back.
Barret,We get him!?
Aerith,Tifa!
Barret,Bout time you showed!
Barret,We get him!?
Tifa,Aerith!
Barret,Bout time you showed!
Aerith,We can do this. We can. We can change it—make it right!
Barret,Go!
Sephiroth,Careful now. That which lies ahead...does not yet exist.
Sephiroth,Our world will become a part of it...one day. But I...will not end. Nor will I have you end.
Cloud,This is...?
Sephiroth,"The edge of creation. Cloud, lend me your strength. Let us defy destiny...together."
Cloud,Never.
Sephiroth,Not yet. Seven seconds till the end. Time enough for you. Perhaps. But what will you do with it? Let's see.
Barret,Marlene!
Barret,I'll come back.
Tifa,So...what now?
Cloud,"Sephiroth. Long as he's still out there, I..."
Barret,I thought you beat him.
Aerith,We can. We will.
Tifa,Count me in.
Barret,"I'm in too! Bastard wants to destroy the whole planet, doesn't he? An enemy of hers is an enemy of Avalanche!"
Aerith,I miss it. The steel sky.
Yuffie,"(hums ""Yuffie's Theme"")"
Yuffie,"Well, guys... Your girl finally made it to Midgar."
Yuffie,Whoa...
Yuffie,Awha! (screams)
Yuffie,(sniffs) Blech!
Yuffie,"You got this, Yuffie! Mm-hm."
Yuffie,"My name is Yuffie, materia hunter and elite special forces operative for the new Wutai government. I have orders to infiltrate Shinra headquarters and steal their ultimate materia. To prove to our common enemy that Wutai is not to be trifled with. Members of Avalanche...with your full support... We got this!"
Yuffie,"So, members of Avalanche... Where are you!? Come get me already!"
Yuffie,Okay. If I was a man in a moogle hat...
Yuffie,"Wait, does this mean what I think it does? Interesting... So, I gotta come to you, do I? You got some nerve! (chuckles)"
Yuffie,Hmph! Guess you're never far from a rat in Midgar! Let's see what you've got!
Yuffie,"Well, that was easy! And my search for the elusive moogle continues."
Yuffie,Huh?
Yuffie,(sighs) No pom...
Yuffie,You okay? Anybody home?
Yuffie,"Well, guess I'm not going anywhere until I get that elevator moving."
Yuffie,"(chuckles) Ah, I never cease to amaze myself."
Yuffie,"Yeesh, this town's a total dump. I thought Midgar was supposed to be ""the marvel of the modern world."" Talk about false advertising. ""City of Mako""? ""City of Garbage,"" more like."
Yuffie,Huh? I gotta do something!
Yuffie,Ah... You'll do the trick. Come on down!
Yuffie,Sweet! Now to save the day!
Yuffie,"Have no fear, Yuffie's here!"
Yuffie,"Uh, so...not even a ""thank you""?"
Yuffie,This is too weird...
Yuffie,"Hn, hn, hah! Okay...! You got this!"
Yuffie,"Huh, okay... That rotten egg smell's gone. Must've gotten used to it. Hah. Way things are goin', I'll be workin' for Shinra next. Nice try, Midgar."
Yuffie,I'm talkin' to myself. City's getting to me!
Yuffie,"Oh, oh, oh! Whadda we have here!? (chuckles) Man, that's gotta be Avalanche! Not bad. Not bad at all... But I can do better!"
Yuffie,Wha...? There's our pom!
Yuffie,"So, you're Avalanche?"
Yuffie,Wha—? W-wait up!
Yuffie,"So, Zhijie, why didn't you come meet me before?"
Yuffie,"I may be elite, but it's not like I've ever been to Midgar. ...And what exactly is a ""W"" anyway?"
Yuffie,Uh-huh...
Yuffie,"This ""kid"" could kick your ass!"
Yuffie,"Oh, don't worry. I know exactly what you're saying!"
Yuffie,And let you walk all over me?
Yuffie,"Hi. My name is Yuffie, materia hunter and elite special forces operative for the new Wutai government. I have orders to infiltrate Shinra HQ and steal their ultimate materia. To prove to our common enemy that Wutai is not to be trifled with. Members of Avalanche, with your full support... We got this!"
Yuffie,"You better believe it! So, did you guys meet Sonon yet? He was supposed to be here."
Yuffie,"Oh he does, does he!?"
Yuffie,As if. Ninjas always travel light. It's like a rule.
Yuffie,But I did bring these—Wutai's famous Da-chao beans. Eat up. And here you go.
Yuffie,Then why don't I join ya!?
Yuffie,Huh?
Yuffie,With all the noise in this city? Im-freakin'-possible. How about you tell me where in the Shinra Building they're keeping that materia instead. Don't hold out on me now. I know you know.
Yuffie,"I see... So... Shinra hides its top secret materia in the basement. (chuckles) You won't have to wait much longer, my precious...I promise."
Yuffie,"You're welcome. So, the materia I'm looking for is in the Shinra Building, right? And where is that, exactly?"
Yuffie,What did you just say?
Yuffie,"Oh, that one. Why didn't you say so?"
Yuffie,"I just wanna make sure I have the plan down pat. You know, like how to get up top and all that."
Yuffie,Sit tight? But I wanna go now...
Yuffie,Harsh.
Yuffie,What's Wall Market?
Yuffie,Mature tastes...
Yuffie,"No, I think I get it. Like bars filled with smoke so thick you can't even see, and drinks so bitter you wanna spit 'em right back out!"
Yuffie,"Where everyone gets drunk and complains about how ""Kids just don't understand the value of hard work. They'll be the death of society."" Ugh, how can they not see that they're the ones destryoing it!?"
Yuffie,"Wutai's got a place like that, where grown-ups drink their lives away. It's called the ""Happy Turtle."""
Yuffie,"You do, huh? (gasp) They're taking down Midgar one citizen at a time!"
Yuffie,"I salute you, Happy Turtle!"
Yuffie,I oughta find him! Man deserves some Da-chao beans.
Yuffie,Huh? Uh...course I do! Why wouldn't I? It's that thing that...stimulates...modulation.
Yuffie,Uh-huh...
Yuffie,"I really don't have time to be playin' around with some stimulator. But, just to be polite, I guess I'll take it for a spin."
Yuffie,"""Fort...Condor""?"
Yuffie,"Uh, yes I have! And what's more, I'm awesome at it. I'll whoop you so hard, you'll wonder if you ever knew the rules!"
Yuffie,You mean you didn't lose on purpose? ...Wow.
Yuffie,I've kinda got better things to do.
Yuffie,Materia!?
Yuffie,Whatever! Bring it on!
Yuffie,Ugh... Al this talking's giving me a headache. I'm gonna go do some recon.
Yuffie,His ways are a mystery.
Yuffie,Sonon's gotta be back by now.
Yuffie,What took you!?
Yuffie,Wh-what?
Yuffie,"Yeah, I don't wanna talk about him. Let's talk about something else. Like how you've adjusted to life here—indulging in ""adult"" pastimes. Which I guess means...drinking yourself stupid! Last thing I need is my partner stinking like an over-the-hill has-been."
Yuffie,"Speaking of drinking...you been to the Happy Turtle? If you're part of Operation Down-in-One, I take it back. I am there next time you go. Don't worry, I can do adult stuff just fine."
Yuffie,"""Boss""? As in me?"
Yuffie,"I...I guess I have! ""Boss,"" huh? I could get used to that. Beats being stuck on the bottom rung, that's for sure. (chuckles)"
Yuffie,Yeah! Yeah!
Yuffie,Stupid bird.
Yuffie,Not at all! Need to scope out the city anyway. Really get to know the enemy.
Yuffie,Be right there!
Yuffie,"Hey, uh...you wanna tell me what you're mumblin' about?"
Yuffie,I'm Yuffie. Neet to meet you. So...what're you researchin'?
Yuffie,Hmmm...sure! Why not. Imma kick its butt!
Yuffie,Uh... What are you talking about? This isn't weird—it's super cute!
Yuffie,Not as lame as Midgar.
Yuffie,"Just saying how much I was looking forward to playing Fort Condor. I could really use the training, y'know?"
Yuffie,(chuckles) What can I say? Talent trumps all.
Yuffie,As if!
Yuffie,Who am I? Someone who doesn't spend all day muttering to themselves in the shadows... Like some kinda Shinra spy!
Yuffie,"Heh. So you're after the grandmaster too? Sorry to burst your bubble, Mr. Shadow Lurker, but I'll be the one takin' home those spoils of war."
Yuffie,"(chuckles) Now I'm taking down Midgar, a citizen at a time."
Yuffie,That all of Midgar's gonna suffer the same fate.
Yuffie,"Hey there, suit. How's that conversation with yourself workin' out?"
Yuffie,"That ""game"" wouldn't happen to be Fort Condor, would it!? If you want, I'll help you figure stuff out."
Yuffie,Starting to get the hang of what? Losing?
Yuffie,Boo!
Yuffie,"Hm? Waiting for somone? Ooh, you got stood up."
Yuffie,I dunno—is he Shinra too?
Yuffie,What's his name?
Yuffie,"Yeah, he sounds great. Say, is that Fort Condor I see over there? You play?"
Yuffie,Wait...did you just call me your friend?
Yuffie,"So, I've been thinkin' about it, and I know just what you need... Round of Fort Condor?"
Yuffie,(laughs)
Yuffie,Hm? What's that I hear? The sound of the world's smallest violin?
Yuffie,So...I couldn't help noticing your Fort Condor set. Got time for a game?
Yuffie,"Then let's do it up! I gotta warn you, though, I'm kind of an expert at this."
Yuffie,"Oho, is that right? Well, you can talk the talk, so let's see ya walk the walk!"
Yuffie,"You freakin' bet I did! Aw, not gonna go cryin' to your cats, are ya!?"
Yuffie,"Looks like you've got your work cut out for you, my furry friends!"
Yuffie,"Hey... Wait a second. That was everyone, right? Including the grandmaster? So where's my materia!? I want it now!"
Yuffie,Uh... I guess so?
Yuffie,Your hypo-thingy's what now?
Yuffie,"Yeah, yeah, skip to the end!"
Yuffie,"did you say ""materia""!? So...you're the Grandmaster!? Whodda thunk! (laughs) How does it feel, Shinra—to see the whole of Midgar brought to its knees by the Amazing Yuffie!"
Yuffie,Anytime!
Yuffie,Wha?
Yuffie,Nope.
Yuffie,Bummer.
Yuffie,That prize is as good as mine!
Yuffie,Hm hm hm hm-hm-hm-hm-hmmm... (hums Happy Turtle theme)
Yuffie,There it is. The call of the turtle!
Yuffie,"You never stood a chance, little guy!"
Yuffie,The gumshoe ninja strikes again!
Yuffie,(screams)
Yuffie,Mm-mm.
Yuffie,Uh...
Yuffie,"Uh, I'm really not here for...whoever he is."
Yuffie,"For, uh...directions! But I'm all good now, thanks!"
Yuffie,Hah... That was a close one.
Yuffie,"I'm comin' for ya, flyer!"
Yuffie,"Heh heh, gotcha!"
Yuffie,(screams)
Yuffie,Flyer acquired!
Yuffie,"Heh heh, gotcha! You thought you could hide from me, didn't ya!"
Yuffie,(gasps) My turtle senses are tingling!
Yuffie,"Heh heh, gotcha!"
Yuffie,And that makes six! Won't Old Snapper be impressed when I rock up with these bad boys.
Yuffie,"Please, it was a piece of cake. Only these Midgarian dummies would find that a challenge. Speaking of which... Here—for a fellow tough nut!"
Yuffie,Mm-hm.
Yuffie,But I thought Zhijie was getting our High-D's. What happened with that?
Yuffie,Those tyrants!
Yuffie,Reowr!
Yuffie,"Way too crowded. I can't stand it. Ugh, and the stench! How can anyone live here?"
Yuffie,Uh...wait a second. Are you actually saying you like it here? I thought you hated it.
Yuffie,Then what was that stuff on the news? About a reactor blowin' up and all. No way that was an accident. It had to be Avalanche.
Yuffie,Sorry...
Yuffie,"Uh, what's up?"
Yuffie,Splinter cell?
Barret,We lost him.
Tifa,He will be okay though...right?
Barret,"Well...of course he will! A little fall ain't gonna stop a hard-ass like him. He'll come swaggerin' back before long, you mark my words."
Tifa,Yeah...I guess he will.
Barret,Now can we talk about President Shithead? Spoutin' all that crap about us!? That lyin' son of a bitch! Working for Wutai!? Avalanche ain't nobody's—
Tifa,Barret.
Tifa,Huh?
Barret,Is that so?
Barret,Don't got time for no low-level mobsters. We got Shinra in our sights.
Barret,Tifa. You and I both know this is far from over. Right? Might as well get some rest—while we still can.
Tifa,Right.
Tifa,You know what? I think I am gonna look into this.
Yuffie,Cool. Should we say hi?
Yuffie,"So, what's wrong with that? Sounds good to me."
Yuffie,"Well, that company almost leveled our home, and they've gotta learn their lesson."
Yuffie,"Yeah, couldn't agree more. Consider it tabled!"
Yuffie,"Like after we steal it? Well, the more materia you have, the stronger you are, right? So once we've got the ultimate materia, we'll be stronger than anyone!"
Yuffie,(chuckles) It's gonna be awesome!
Yuffie,"Uh, sure is!"
Yuffie,(chuckles)
Yuffie,(chuckles)
Yuffie,Hey! What am I? Chopped liver!?
Yuffie,"(laughs) Know any kids who can do that? No you don't, 'cause I'm an adult."
Yuffie,"Also, I'm pretty hot stuff myself, thank you very much."
Yuffie,Okay...
Yuffie,"So, who were those creeps anyway?"
Yuffie,Oho? And how do you know what it looks like?
Yuffie,Wait for who?
Yuffie,"Hey, uh... What's up with that guy?"
Yuffie,"Them again!? Oh, Shinra's so gonna get it!"
Yuffie,"Hey, hold up!"
Yuffie,Try it. You'll love it.
Yuffie,Foreigners and their weak jaws...
Yuffie,"Enjoy your materia while you still can, Shinra, 'cause we're comin'!"
Yuffie,Aw! Hmph.
Yuffie,A-wha...?
Yuffie,"""Change of plans""?"
Yuffie,"Well, if you ask me, it's high time things picked up around here."
Yuffie,"Yeah, I'm not your garden-variety Wutaian. I'm a rare bloom!"
Yuffie,"Ooh, I'm so gonna use that!"
Yuffie,Hey! That's Zhijie.
Yuffie,Do you have any idea what Zhijie actually did?
Yuffie,"Well, now I feel bad."
Yuffie,Right.
Yuffie,Oho! Talk about fast. Is he one of us?
Yuffie,"This some kind of factory or something? It reminds me of a place I passed through when I first got here. And if it's anything like that, it'll be crawlin' with monsters."
Yuffie,Aha! Been lookin' for you!
Yuffie,"Hey, you think Nayo's alright?"
Yuffie,"You know, she's actually pretty cool. I feel bad saying this, but after what happened back home, I just kinda assumed no one in Avalanche could be trusted. Like, they were all the same as the ones I fought."
Yuffie,"But it looks like Avalanche has changed a lot since that went down, huh?"
Yuffie,C'mon.
Yuffie,"(screams) Man, that stings... Alright, now you've done it! When this is over, you're gettin' it good! Enjoy your freedom while you can, Zhijie!"
Yuffie,You heard the main.
Yuffie,(stumbles)
Yuffie,(chuckles)
Yuffie,Well that sucked. Why did tailing people have to be so hard?
Yuffie,"Eh. Sure, whatever. Now how do we find Zhijie?"
Yuffie,"Yeah, works for me."
Yuffie,Now how are we gonna get across. Hmmm...
Yuffie,Oho! Is that a switch I see?
Yuffie,Which was...?
Yuffie,Oh. That.
Yuffie,Yeah... I guess so.
Yuffie,"I know what you mean, though... They're all just really good people, huh."
Yuffie,Right...
Yuffie,"Yeah, yeah, I know...! Gotta be quiet... Very quiet... As quiet as a mouse..."
Yuffie,Eek!
Yuffie,(chuckles) Uh... Good morning!
Yuffie,"Alright, it can't be far now. Let's get our rears in gear! Big ""g"", little ""o"", go, go, go!"
Yuffie,"Up ahead. Building just screams ""important."""
Yuffie,"Bleh, why'd there have to be so many guards?"
Yuffie,Understood.
Yuffie,"Huh. Nice goin', Zhijie."
Yuffie,Born ready!
Yuffie,"A diversion, huh? I like it. But don't forget I'm the leading lady."
Yuffie,"Hey, you! Evildoers! Over here!"
Yuffie,That's exactly what I was hoping you'd ask!
Yuffie,And...action!
Yuffie,"Some know me as a beguiling ninja! Others as the world's greatest materia hunter. But! Who am I truly? Well, excited onlookers, wonder no more!"
Yuffie,Before you stands a rare bloom the single white rose of Wutai...the one-and-only Yuffie! (coughs)
Yuffie,"Hey, who're you callin' a kid!? (stumbles)"
Yuffie,Uh...guh...uhk...
Yuffie,(chuckles)
Yuffie,No freakin' way!
Yuffie,Couldn't they have made it less gross?
Yuffie,"Oho... Running away, are we?"
Yuffie,"Or maybe it's doing one of those...""tactical retreats""?"
Yuffie,It's spitting little critters!
Yuffie,They've got lasers too! And where there's lasers...
Yuffie,How're we supposed to dodge those things!?
Yuffie,So now you've come crawling down.
Yuffie,Get wrecked!
Yuffie,"Oh, we'll make it serious, alright—dead serious."
Yuffie,(chuckles) You see that?
Yuffie,Yep.
Yuffie,(gasps) Hahaha... It was nothin'!
Yuffie,Got it.
Yuffie,Right.
Yuffie,"Don't forget to tell the splinter cell—about Sector 7, I mean!"
Yuffie,Ready!
Yuffie,Kay.
Yuffie,I think we're good here. Let's roll.
Yuffie,What's with all these people?
Yuffie,All aboard!
Yuffie,Oh boy...
Yuffie,(gulps) I'll be fine...as long as I'm standing up...
Yuffie,Don't laugh.
Yuffie,Who's Melphie?
Yuffie,Huh...
Yuffie,"""Had""?"
Yuffie,Yeah... They do. But I'm not your sister.
Yuffie,Enough to make you sick. Let's get this over with.
Yuffie,"You're up, High-D!"
Yuffie,"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!"
Yuffie,I would. A hundred percent! (chuckles)
Yuffie,Open up!
Yuffie,"Calm down, Sonon. Calm down. Remember we're here for a reason."
Yuffie,Don't be. I was ready to strangle her myself. And that's before she sent us off in the wrong direction...
Yuffie,"Only one way to find out. Don't worry, we'll get to Materia Research eventually. Just a little longer, my precious..."
Yuffie,"Just look at this place. Weapons here, weapons there, weapons everywhere! They're ready for some serious action."
Yuffie,"Duh. Unlike my old man, I'm not some lazy drunk. I fight for what I believe in, something he'd never understand."
Yuffie,"Behind bars, you mean? Not well, if the government's got anything to say about it. Good on 'em. Jail's where he belongs."
Yuffie,You know what? Let's drop it. Not exactly my favorite topic. It's only gonna make me mad. More importantly...
Yuffie,What? There's more?
Yuffie,Why did I ever think for a second she'd be nice to us!? She knows damn well it's gonna be a pain in the ass gettin' up there.
Yuffie,"There we go. Honestly, how do I do it? Now then, Sonon, how ya feel about givin' me a boost?"
Yuffie,"Okay, get to climbin'!"
Yuffie,"Oh, materia, where are you?"
Yuffie,Hm? Is that materia I smell?
Yuffie,This their idea of mood lighting? 'Cause it's bad.
Yuffie,Talk about hitting the jackpot! This must be where they make their materia!
Yuffie,Totally. After I grab a few souvenirs.
Yuffie,"Wait, is that a security grate or a ladder? Thanks, Shinra!"
Yuffie,"Huh, that's weird... Not even a whiff of materia up here... But then there's nowhere else to go."
Yuffie,"Not long now, my precious. You'll be safe in my arms soon!"
Yuffie,And what do we have here? A secret materia vault perhaps?
Yuffie,Uh...uh-oh.
Yuffie,"(groans) Aw, c'mon! How could we have gotten so lost!?"
Yuffie,Sure...
Yuffie,You ate it!
Yuffie,"Man, I'm glad you're here!"
Yuffie,It really helps—knowing I'm not alone in all this.
Yuffie,Aha! Think I found our way across!
Yuffie,Training? Really? Just give us what we came for already!
Yuffie,Sonon! Check that out!
Yuffie,"This has to be it! Oh, sweet baby, come to mama!"
Yuffie,Can't see squat. Light. Light! I need more light!
Yuffie,"Now we're cookin'! I'm comin', materia, ready or not!"
Yuffie,Man... Another stupid dud!
Yuffie,Wha—? Uh-oh...
Yuffie,"Quit holdin' out on us, Shinra! We're here for materia, not these dorks!"
Yuffie,(screams)
Yuffie,(screams)
Yuffie,"That we're walking into a trap, I guess. But it's nothing we can't handle, right?"
Yuffie,"""May have""!? How 'bout ""did"", you old hag!?"
Yuffie,Where are we?
Yuffie,"That thing...can't be operational, can it?"
Yuffie,Quit acting all superior. We both know you're afraid of us!
Yuffie,You should know there's more where we came from—lots more! And you'll never see 'em comin'! Just imagine a whole clan of ninjas landing on your doorstep!
Yuffie,"Well, you can't!"
Yuffie,What the—
Yuffie,"Oh look, we're surrounded!"
Yuffie,Right on! They're as good as scrap!
Yuffie,"Hey, no fair!"
Yuffie,Wha—Come back!
Yuffie,So what! Just smash it up!
Yuffie,Hey! Don't you know that's cheating!?
Yuffie,More? How many of those things you got?
Yuffie,Hellooo!
Yuffie,"My, my, my, how the tables have turned..."
Yuffie,"That's enough, Sonon. I got this. Alright, lady, out with it. Tell us where you're hiding the new materia. Don't play dumb now. We know you've been cooking up something super-powerful."
Yuffie,What was...?
Yuffie,"Alright, but make it quick."
Yuffie,"Yeah, right. You must think I'm stupid."
Yuffie,What other plans?
Yuffie,I don't get it. You're gonna drop a plate? And?
Yuffie,What the—!?
Yuffie,Who're these assholes!?
Yuffie,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but..."
Yuffie,There is no ultimate materia—not yet. She said it's still in the works. And she mentioned somethin' else. They're gonna drop Plate Number 7.
Yuffie,They're gonna drop Plate Number 7 on the slums...apparently.
Yuffie,Wait! So Zhijie was being serious!?
Yuffie,Let's go!
Yuffie,No way I'm givin' up!
Yuffie,I'm not goin' down till I've been to the Happy Turtle!
Yuffie,(screams)
Yuffie,Is it over?
Yuffie,"Ow... Man, I so don't wanna go back out there...but I don't think we've got a choice."
Yuffie,"Work, you stupid..."
Yuffie,No good. Door won't budge.
Yuffie,What was that?
Yuffie,No fair!
Yuffie,Where are these freaks even coming from!? 'Cause I'd really like 'em to stop!
Yuffie,"Joke's on you, Shinra, if you think we're dying in this ugly box!"
Yuffie,"Okay, this is gettin' old!"
Yuffie,What the—!? Why can't I hit it!?
Yuffie,Leave it to me!
Yuffie,Now can we please get outta here already?
Yuffie,What are you doing? Aren't you all on the same team?
Yuffie,Deep...ground?
Yuffie,"Cool. Now, mind moving aside?"
Yuffie,"Well, can't blame a girl for trying."
Yuffie,"What's with this company? They have a ""freaks only"" policy?"
Yuffie,You're dead!
Yuffie,"Dunno what this crap is, but it's definitely not good!"
Yuffie,Uhn heh...! Urk...!
Yuffie,No darkness! Get it away from me! Get it away!
Yuffie,Ew...I don't want that stuff anywhere near me!
Yuffie,This is bad!
Yuffie,No!
Yuffie,Gross! It's everywhere!
Yuffie,Just stand back. Your boss has got ya covered!
Yuffie,"Yeah, no. I don't think so."
Yuffie,Don't gotta tell me twice!
Yuffie,Did we?
Yuffie,Awesome...(sighs)
Yuffie,But I'm so tired...
Yuffie,You win. Sheesh.
Yuffie,Aha!
Yuffie,"Hey, whaddaya think you're—"
Yuffie,Sonon?
Yuffie,"No, I—"
Yuffie,But...
Yuffie,Sonon...?
Yuffie,No... Stop it...
Yuffie,Sonon!?
Yuffie,(cries)
Yuffie,(cries) You asshole! I'm not a kid! I'm not your sister!
Yuffie,This is just wrong... (screams)
Yuffie,"(hums ""Chocobo Theme"")"
Yuffie,Don't think I can do this alone.
Yuffie,The Amazing Yuffie wants you! Join her team and the sky's the limit!
Tifa,"Hey, Barret. We really walking the whole way?"
Barret,Yup.
Tifa,"Kalm's still pretty far, though, isn't it?"
Barret,"Nother full day, give or take."
Aerith,"Question... When my mom says, ""a full day,"" she means from the time you get up in the morning till the time you go to bed...but for me, it means from the time you get up in the morning all the way through till the time you get up the next morning. So, which is it for you?"
Barret,Gotta go with Elmyra on that one.
Aerith,"Phew, that's a relief!"
Tifa,"Is it, though?"
Barret,"Cloud. Bet you've had to hoof it from sunup to sundown tons of times. This is all just same old, same old, right?"
Cloud,"That's right. But even so, we're all gonna need to stop and rest. Especially you."
Barret,"Yeah, yeah, I know... Anyway, marchin' into the unknown ain't easy, but don't worry, 'cause I'm here to lead the way!"

Barret,Of course it is! (laughs)
Barret,"Alright, everyone—let's stop here for a minute. Leader's orders! Now breathe in that fresh air!"

Aerith,Cool.
Tifa,Hm? No way! A car!

Barret,What is it with these damn birds!?
Tifa,"Uh, sorry 'bout that."

Aerith,Where's a roof when you need one?
Cloud,Gonna be okay?
